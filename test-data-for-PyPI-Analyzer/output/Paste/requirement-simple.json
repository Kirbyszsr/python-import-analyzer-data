  "description": "\n*Paste is in maintenance mode and recently moved from bitbucket to github.\nPatches are accepted to keep it on life support, but for the most part, please\nconsider using other options.*\n\nPaste provides several pieces of \"middleware\" (or filters) that can be nested\nto build web applications.  Each piece of middleware uses the WSGI (`PEP 333`_)\ninterface, and should be compatible with other middleware based on those\ninterfaces.\n\n.. _PEP 333: http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0333/\n\n* `Paste project at GitHub (source code, bug tracker)\n  <https://github.com/cdent/paste/>`_\n* `Paste on the Python Cheeseshop (PyPI)\n  <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Paste>`_\n* `Paste on Read the Docs\n  <https://pythonpaste.readthedocs.io>`_\n\nSee also:\n\n* `WebOb <https://docs.pylonsproject.org/projects/webob>`_\n\nIncludes these features...\n\nTesting\n-------\n\n* A fixture for testing WSGI applications conveniently and in-process,\n  in ``paste.fixture``\n\n* A fixture for testing command-line applications, also in\n  ``paste.fixture``\n\n* Check components for WSGI-compliance in ``paste.lint``\n\nDispatching\n-----------\n\n* Chain and cascade WSGI applications (returning the first non-error\n  response) in ``paste.cascade``\n\n* Dispatch to several WSGI applications based on URL prefixes, in\n  ``paste.urlmap``\n\n* Allow applications to make subrequests and forward requests\n  internally, in ``paste.recursive``\n\nWeb Application\n---------------\n\n* Run CGI programs as WSGI applications in ``paste.cgiapp``\n\n* Traverse files and load WSGI applications from ``.py`` files (or\n  static files), in ``paste.urlparser``\n\n* Serve static directories of files, also in ``paste.urlparser``; also\n  in that module serving from Egg resources using ``pkg_resources``.\n\nTools\n-----\n\n* Catch HTTP-related exceptions (e.g., ``HTTPNotFound``) and turn them\n  into proper responses in ``paste.httpexceptions``\n\n* Several authentication techniques, including HTTP (Basic and\n  Digest), signed cookies, and CAS single-signon, in the\n  ``paste.auth`` package.\n\n* Create sessions in ``paste.session`` and ``paste.flup_session``\n\n* Gzip responses in ``paste.gzip``\n\n* A wide variety of routines for manipulating WSGI requests and\n  producing responses, in ``paste.request``, ``paste.response`` and\n  ``paste.wsgilib``\n\nDebugging Filters\n-----------------\n\n* Catch (optionally email) errors with extended tracebacks (using\n  Zope/ZPT conventions) in ``paste.exceptions``\n\n* Catch errors presenting a `cgitb\n  <http://docs.python.org/2/library/cgitb.html>`_-based\n  output, in ``paste.cgitb_catcher``.\n\n* Profile each request and append profiling information to the HTML,\n  in ``paste.debug.profile``\n\n* Capture ``print`` output and present it in the browser for\n  debugging, in ``paste.debug.prints``\n\n* Validate all HTML output from applications using the `WDG Validator\n  <http://www.htmlhelp.com/tools/validator/>`_, appending any errors\n  or warnings to the page, in ``paste.debug.wdg_validator``\n\nOther Tools\n-----------\n\n* A file monitor to allow restarting the server when files have been\n  updated (for automatic restarting when editing code) in\n  ``paste.reloader``\n\n* A class for generating and traversing URLs, and creating associated\n  HTML code, in ``paste.url``\n\nThe official development repo is at https://github.com/cdent/paste.\n\n\n",
