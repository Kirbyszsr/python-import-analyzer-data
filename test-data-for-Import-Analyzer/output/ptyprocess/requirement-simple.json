There might be a password\nprompt that doesn't read from stdin, output that changes when it's going to a\npipe rather than a terminal, or curses-style interfaces that rely on a terminal.\nIf you need to automate these things, running the process in a pseudo terminal\n(pty) is the answer.\n\nInterface::\n\n    p = PtyProcessUnicode.spawn(['python'])\n    p.read(20)\n    p.write('6+6\\n')\n    p.read(20)\n",
