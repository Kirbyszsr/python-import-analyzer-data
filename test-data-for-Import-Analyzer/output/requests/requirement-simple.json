  "description": "# Requests\n\n**Requests** is a simple, yet elegant HTTP library.\n\n```python\n>>> import requests\n>>> r = requests.get('https://api.github.com/user', auth=('user', 'pass'))\n>>> r.status_code\n200\n>>> r.headers['content-type']\n'application/json; charset=utf8'\n>>> r.encoding\n'utf-8'\n>>> r.text\n'{\"type\":\"User\"...'\n>>> r.json()\n{'disk_usage': 368627, 'private_gists': 484, ...}\n```\n\nRequests allows you to send HTTP/1.1 requests extremely easily. There\u2019s no need to manually add query strings to your URLs, or to form-encode your `PUT` & `POST` data \u2014 but nowadays, just use the `json` method!\n\nRequests is one of the most downloaded Python package today, pulling in around `14M downloads / week`\u2014 according to GitHub, Requests is currently [depended upon](https://github.com/psf/requests/network/dependents?package_id=UGFja2FnZS01NzA4OTExNg%3D%3D) by `500,000+` repositories. You may certainly put your trust in this code.\n\n[![Downloads](https://pepy.tech/badge/requests/month)](https://pepy.tech/project/requests/month)\n[![Supported Versions](https://img.shields.io/pypi/pyversions/requests.svg)](https://pypi.org/project/requests)\n[![Contributors](https://img.shields.io/github/contributors/psf/requests.svg)](https://github.com/psf/requests/graphs/contributors)\n\n## Installing Requests and Supported Versions\n\nRequests is available on PyPI:\n\n```console\n$ python -m pip install requests\n```\n\nRequests officially supports Python 2.7 & 3.5+.\n\n## Supported Features & Best\u2013Practices\n\nRequests is ready for the demands of building robust and reliable HTTP\u2013speaking applications, for the needs of today.\n\n- Keep-Alive & Connection Pooling\n- International Domains and URLs\n- Sessions with Cookie Persistence\n- Browser-style TLS/SSL Verification\n- Basic & Digest Authentication\n- Familiar `dict`\u2013like Cookies\n- Automatic Content Decompression and Decoding\n- Multi-part File Uploads\n- SOCKS Proxy Support\n- Connection Timeouts\n- Streaming Downloads\n- Automatic honoring of `.netrc`\n- Chunked HTTP Requests\n\n## API Reference and User Guide available on [Read the Docs](https://requests.readthedocs.io)\n\n[![Read the Docs](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/psf/requests/master/ext/ss.png)](https://requests.readthedocs.io)\n\n---\n\n[![Kenneth Reitz](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/psf/requests/master/ext/kr.png)](https://kennethreitz.org) [![Python Software Foundation](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/psf/requests/master/ext/psf.png)](https://www.python.org/psf)\n\n\n",
