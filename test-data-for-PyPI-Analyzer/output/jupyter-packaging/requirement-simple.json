If not given, no pre-build function will run.\n\nThe optional `tool.jupyter-packaging.build-args` sections accepts a dict of keyword arguments to\ngive to the pre-build command.\n\nThe build backend does not handle the `develop` command (`pip install -e .`).\nIf desired, you can wrap just that command:\n\n```py\nimport setuptools\n\ntry:\n    from jupyter_packaging import wrap_installers, npm_builder\n    builder = npm_builder(build_cmd=\"build:dev\")\n    cmdclass = wrap_installers(pre_develop=builder)\nexcept ImportError:\n    cmdclass = {}\n\nsetup(cmdclass=cmdclass))\n```\n\nThe optional `tool.jupyter-packaging.options` section accepts the following options:\n\n- `skip-if-exists`: A list of local files whose presence causes the prebuild to skip\n- `ensured-targets`: A list of local file paths that should exist when the dist commands are run\n\n### As a Vendored File\n\nVendor `setupbase.py` locally alongside `setup.py` and import the module directly.\n\n```py\nimport setuptools\nfrom setupbase import wrap_installers, npm_builder\nfunc = npm_builder()\ncmdclass = wrap_installers(post_develop=func, pre_dist=func)\nsetup(cmdclass=cmdclass)\n```\n\n## Usage Notes\n\n- We recommend using `include_package_data=True` and `MANIFEST.in` to control the assets included in the [package](https://setuptools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/userguide/datafiles.html).\n- Tools like [`check-manifest`](https://github.com/mgedmin/check-manifest) or [`manifix`](https://github.com/vidartf/manifix) can be used to ensure the desired assets are included.\n- Simple uses of `data_files` can be handled in `setup.cfg` or in `setup.py`.  If recursive directories are needed use `get_data_files()` from this package.\n- Unfortunately `data_files` are not supported in `develop` mode (a limitation of `setuptools`).  You can work around it by doing a full install (`pip install .`) before the develop install (`pip install -e .`), or by adding a script to push the data files to `sys.base_prefix`.\n\n\n## Development Install\n\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter-packaging.git\ncd jupyter-packaging\npip install -e .\n```\n\nYou can test changes locally by creating a `pyproject.toml` with the following, replacing the local path to the git checkout:\n\n```toml\n[build-system]\nrequires = [\"jupyter_packaging@file://<path-to-git-checkout>\"]\nbuild-backend = \"setuptools.build_meta\"\n```\n\nNote: you need to run `pip cache remove jupyter_packaging` any time changes are made to prevent `pip` from using a cached version of the source.\n\n\n",
