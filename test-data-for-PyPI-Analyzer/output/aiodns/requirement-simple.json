It returns an\n  instance of ``asyncio.Future``. The actual result of the DNS query is taken directly from pycares.\n  As of version 1.0.0 of aiodns (and pycares, for that matter) results are always namedtuple-like\n  objects with different attributes. Please check `the documentation <http://pycares.readthedocs.org/en/latest/channel.html#pycares.Channel.query>`_\n  for the result fields.\n* ``gethostbyname(host, socket_family)``: Do a DNS resolution for the given\n  hostname and the desired type of address family (i.e. ``socket.AF_INET``).\n  While ``query()`` always performs a request to a DNS server,\n  ``gethostbyname()`` first looks into ``/etc/hosts`` and thus can resolve\n  local hostnames (such as ``localhost``).  Please check `the documentation\n  <http://pycares.readthedocs.io/en/latest/channel.html#pycares.Channel.gethostbyname>`_\n  for the result fields. The actual result of the call is a ``asyncio.Future``.\n* ``gethostbyaddr(name)``: Make a reverse lookup for an address.\n* ``cancel()``: Cancel all pending DNS queries. All futures will get ``DNSError`` exception set, with\n  ``ARES_ECANCELLED`` errno.\n\n\nRunning the test suite\n======================\n\nTo run the test suite: ``python tests.py``\n\n\nAuthor\n======\n\nSa\u00fal Ibarra Corretg\u00e9 <s@saghul.net>\n\n\nLicense\n=======\n\naiodns uses the MIT license, check LICENSE file.\n\n\nPython versions\n===============\n\nPython >= 3.5 are supported.\n\n\nContributing\n============\n\nIf you'd like to contribute, fork the project, make a patch and send a pull\nrequest. Have a look at the surrounding code and please, make yours look\nalike :-)\n\n\n\n",
