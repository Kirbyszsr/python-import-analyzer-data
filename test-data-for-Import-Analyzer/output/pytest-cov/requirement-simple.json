Compared to just using ``coverage run`` this plugin does some extras:\n\n* Subprocess support: you can fork or run stuff in a subprocess and will get covered without any fuss.\n* Xdist support: you can use all of pytest-xdist's features and still get coverage.\n* Consistent pytest behavior. If you run ``coverage run -m pytest`` you will have slightly different ``sys.path`` (CWD will be\n  in it, unlike when running ``pytest``).\n\nAll features offered by the coverage package should work, either through pytest-cov's command line options or\nthrough coverage's config file.\n\n* Free software: MIT license\n\nInstallation\n============\n\nInstall with pip::\n\n    pip install pytest-cov\n\nFor distributed testing support install pytest-xdist::\n\n    pip install pytest-xdist\n\nUpgrading from ancient pytest-cov\n---------------------------------\n\n`pytest-cov 2.0` is using a new ``.pth`` file (``pytest-cov.pth``). You may want to manually remove the older\n``init_cov_core.pth`` from site-packages as it's not automatically removed.\n\nUninstalling\n------------\n\nUninstall with pip::\n\n    pip uninstall pytest-cov\n\nUnder certain scenarios a stray ``.pth`` file may be left around in site-packages.\n\n* `pytest-cov 2.0` may leave a ``pytest-cov.pth`` if you installed without wheels\n  (``easy_install``, ``setup.py install`` etc).\n* `pytest-cov 1.8 or older` will leave a ``init_cov_core.pth``.\n\nUsage\n=====\n\n::\n\n    pytest --cov=myproj tests/\n\nWould produce a report like::\n\n    -------------------- coverage: ... ---------------------\n    Name                 Stmts   Miss  Cover\n    ----------------------------------------\n    myproj/__init__          2      0   100%\n    myproj/myproj          257     13    94%\n    myproj/feature4286      94      7    92%\n    ----------------------------------------\n    TOTAL                  353     20    94%\n\nDocumentation\n=============\n\n    http://pytest-cov.rtfd.org/\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCoverage Data File\n==================\n\nThe data file is erased at the beginning of testing to ensure clean data for each test run. If you\nneed to combine the coverage of several test runs you can use the ``--cov-append`` option to append\nthis coverage data to coverage data from previous test runs.\n\nThe data file is left at the end of testing so that it is possible to use normal coverage tools to\nexamine it.\n\nLimitations\n===========\n\nFor distributed testing the workers must have the pytest-cov package installed.  This is needed since\nthe plugin must be registered through setuptools for pytest to start the plugin on the\nworker.\n\nFor subprocess measurement environment variables must make it from the main process to the\nsubprocess.  The python used by the subprocess must have pytest-cov installed.  The subprocess must\ndo normal site initialisation so that the environment variables can be detected and coverage\nstarted.\n\n\nAcknowledgements\n================\n\nWhilst this plugin has been built fresh from the ground up it has been influenced by the work done\non pytest-coverage (Ross Lawley, James Mills, Holger Krekel) and nose-cover (Jason Pellerin) which are\nother coverage plugins.\n\nNed Batchelder for coverage and its ability to combine the coverage results of parallel runs.\n\nHolger Krekel for pytest with its distributed testing support.\n\nJason Pellerin for nose.\n\nMichael Foord for unittest2.\n\nNo doubt others have contributed to these tools as well.\n\nChangelog\n=========\n\n\n2.12.0 (2021-05-14)\n-------------------\n\n* Added coverage's `toml` extra to install requirements in setup.py.\n  Contributed by Christian Riedel in `#410 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-cov/pull/410>`_.\n* Fixed ``pytest_cov.__version__`` to have the right value (string with version instead of a string\n  including ``__version__ =``).\n* Fixed license classifier in ``setup.py``.\n  Contributed by Chris Sreesangkom in `#467 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-cov/pull/467>`_.\n* Fixed *commits since* badge.\n  Contributed by Terence Honles in `#470 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-cov/pull/470>`_.\n\n2.11.1 (2021-01-20)\n-------------------\n\n* Fixed support for newer setuptools (v42+).\n  Contributed by Micha\u0142 G\u00f3rny in `#451 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-cov/pull/451>`_.\n\n2.11.0 (2021-01-18)\n-------------------\n\n* Bumped minimum coverage requirement to 5.2.1.
