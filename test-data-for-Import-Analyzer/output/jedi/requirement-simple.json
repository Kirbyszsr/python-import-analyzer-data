Jedi has a focus on autocompletion and goto\nfunctionality. Other features include refactoring, code search and finding\nreferences.\n\nJedi has a simple API to work with. There is a reference implementation as a\n`VIM-Plugin <https://github.com/davidhalter/jedi-vim>`_. Autocompletion in your\nREPL is also possible, IPython uses it natively and for the CPython REPL you\ncan install it. Jedi is well tested and bugs should be rare.\n\nJedi can currently be used with the following editors/projects:\n\n- Vim (jedi-vim_, YouCompleteMe_, deoplete-jedi_, completor.vim_)\n- `Visual Studio Code`_ (via `Python Extension <https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python>`_)\n- Emacs (Jedi.el_, company-mode_, elpy_, anaconda-mode_, ycmd_)\n- Sublime Text (SublimeJEDI_ [ST2 + ST3], anaconda_ [only ST3])\n- TextMate_ (Not sure if it's actually working)\n- Kate_ version 4.13+ supports it natively, you have to enable it, though.  [`see\n  <https://projects.kde.org/projects/kde/applications/kate/repository/show?rev=KDE%2F4.13>`_]\n- Atom_ (autocomplete-python-jedi_)\n- `GNOME Builder`_ (with support for GObject Introspection)\n- Gedit (gedi_)\n- wdb_ - Web Debugger\n- `Eric IDE`_ (Available as a plugin)\n- `IPython 6.0.0+ <https://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/whatsnew/version6.html>`_\n- `xonsh shell <https://xon.sh/contents.html>`_ has `jedi extension <https://xon.sh/xontribs.html#jedi>`_\n\nand many more!\n\nThere are a few language servers that use Jedi:\n\n- `jedi-language-server <https://github.com/pappasam/jedi-language-server>`_\n- `python-language-server <https://github.com/palantir/python-language-server>`_\n- `anakin-language-server <https://github.com/muffinmad/anakin-language-server>`_\n\nHere are some pictures taken from jedi-vim_:\n\n.. image:: https://github.com/davidhalter/jedi/raw/master/docs/_screenshots/screenshot_complete.png\n\nCompletion for almost anything:\n\n.. image:: https://github.com/davidhalter/jedi/raw/master/docs/_screenshots/screenshot_function.png\n\nDocumentation:\n\n.. image:: https://github.com/davidhalter/jedi/raw/master/docs/_screenshots/screenshot_pydoc.png\n\n\nGet the latest version from `github <https://github.com/davidhalter/jedi>`_\n(master branch should always be kind of stable/working).\n\nDocs are available at `https://jedi.readthedocs.org/en/latest/\n<https://jedi.readthedocs.org/en/latest/>`_. Pull requests with enhancements\nand/or fixes are awesome and most welcome. Jedi uses `semantic versioning\n<https://semver.org/>`_.\n\nIf you want to stay **up-to-date** with releases, please **subscribe** to this\nmailing list: https://groups.google.com/g/jedi-announce. To subscribe you can\nsimply send an empty email to ``jedi-announce+subscribe@googlegroups.com``.\n\nIssues & Questions\n==================\n\nYou can file issues and questions in the `issue tracker\n<https://github.com/davidhalter/jedi/>`. Alternatively you can also ask on\n`Stack Overflow <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/python-jedi>`_ with\nthe label ``python-jedi``.\n\nInstallation\n============\n\n`Check out the docs <https://jedi.readthedocs.org/en/latest/docs/installation.html>`_.\n\nFeatures and Limitations\n========================\n\nJedi's features are listed here:\n`Features <https://jedi.readthedocs.org/en/latest/docs/features.html>`_.\n\nYou can run Jedi on Python 3.6+ but it should also\nunderstand code that is older than those versions. Additionally you should be\nable to use `Virtualenvs <https://jedi.readthedocs.org/en/latest/docs/api.html#environments>`_\nvery well.\n\nTips on how to use Jedi efficiently can be found `here\n<https://jedi.readthedocs.org/en/latest/docs/features.html#recipes>`_.\n\nAPI\n---\n\nYou can find a comprehensive documentation for the\n`API here <https://jedi.readthedocs.org/en/latest/docs/api.html>`_.\n\nAutocompletion / Goto / Documentation\n-------------------------------------\n\nThere are the following commands:\n\n- ``jedi.Script.goto``\n- ``jedi.Script.infer``\n- ``jedi.Script.help``\n- ``jedi.Script.complete``\n- ``jedi.Script.get_references``\n- ``jedi.Script.get_signatures``\n- ``jedi.Script.get_context``\n\nThe returned objects are very powerful and are really all you might need.\n\nAutocompletion in your REPL (IPython, etc.)\n-------------------------------------------\n\nJedi is a dependency of IPython. Autocompletion in IPython with Jedi is\ntherefore possible without additional configuration.\n\nHere is an `example video <https://vimeo.com/122332037>`_ how REPL completion\ncan look like.\nFor the ``python`` shell you can enable tab completion in a `REPL\n<https://jedi.readthedocs.org/en/latest/docs/usage.html#tab-completion-in-the-python-shell>`_.\n\nStatic Analysis\n---------------\n\nFor a lot of forms of static analysis, you can try to use\n``jedi.Script(...).get_names``. It will return a list of names that you can\nthen filter and work with. There is also a way to list the syntax errors in a\nfile: ``jedi.Script.get_syntax_errors``.\n\n\nRefactoring\n-----------\n\nJedi supports the following refactorings:\n\n- ``jedi.Script.inline``\n- ``jedi.Script.rename``\n- ``jedi.Script.extract_function``\n- ``jedi.Script.extract_variable``\n\nCode Search\n-----------\n\nThere is support for module search with ``jedi.Script.search``, and project\nsearch for ``jedi.Project.search``. The way to search is either by providing a\nname like ``foo`` or by using dotted syntax like ``foo.bar``. Additionally you\ncan provide the API type like ``class foo.bar.Bar``. There are also the\nfunctions ``jedi.Script.complete_search`` and ``jedi.Project.complete_search``.\n\nDevelopment\n===========\n\nThere's a pretty good and extensive `development documentation\n<https://jedi.readthedocs.org/en/latest/docs/development.html>`_.\n\nTesting\n=======\n\nThe test suite uses ``pytest``::\n\n    pip install pytest\n\nIf you want to test only a specific Python version (e.g. Python 3.8), it is as\neasy as::\n\n    python3.8 -m pytest\n\nFor more detailed information visit the `testing documentation\n<https://jedi.readthedocs.org/en/latest/docs/testing.html>`_.\n\nAcknowledgements\n================\n\nThanks a lot to all the\n`contributors <https://jedi.readthedocs.org/en/latest/docs/acknowledgements.html>`_!\n\n\n.. _jedi-vim: https://github.com/davidhalter/jedi-vim\n.. _youcompleteme: https://github.com/ycm-core/YouCompleteMe\n.. _deoplete-jedi: https://github.com/zchee/deoplete-jedi\n.. _completor.vim: https://github.com/maralla/completor.vim\n.. _Jedi.el: https://github.com/tkf/emacs-jedi\n.. _company-mode: https://github.com/syohex/emacs-company-jedi\n.. _elpy: https://github.com/jorgenschaefer/elpy\n.. _anaconda-mode: https://github.com/proofit404/anaconda-mode\n.. _ycmd: https://github.com/abingham/emacs-ycmd\n.. _sublimejedi: https://github.com/srusskih/SublimeJEDI\n.. _anaconda: https://github.com/DamnWidget/anaconda\n.. _wdb: https://github.com/Kozea/wdb\n.. _TextMate: https://github.com/lawrenceakka/python-jedi.tmbundle\n.. _Kate: https://kate-editor.org\n.. _Atom: https://atom.io/\n.. _autocomplete-python-jedi: https://atom.io/packages/autocomplete-python-jedi\n.. _GNOME Builder: https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Builder\n.. _Visual Studio Code: https://code.visualstudio.com/\n.. _gedi: https://github.com/isamert/gedi\n.. _Eric IDE: https://eric-ide.python-projects.org\n\n\n.. :changelog:\n\nChangelog\n---------\n\nUnreleased\n++++++++++\n\n0.18.0 (2020-12-25)\n+++++++++++++++++++\n\n- Dropped Python 2 and Python 3.5\n- Using ``pathlib.Path()`` as an output instead of ``str`` in most places:\n  - ``Project.path``\n  - ``Script.path``\n  - ``Definition.module_path``\n  - ``Refactoring.get_renames``\n  - ``Refactoring.get_changed_files``\n- Functions with ``@property`` now return ``property`` instead of ``function``\n  in ``Name().type``\n- Started using annotations\n- Better support for the walrus operator\n- Project attributes are now read accessible\n- Removed all deprecations\n\nThis is likely going to be the last minor release before 1.0.\n\n0.17.2 (2020-07-17)\n+++++++++++++++++++\n\n- Added an option to pass environment variables to ``Environment``\n- ``Project(...).path`` exists now\n- Support for Python 3.9\n- A few bugfixes\n\nThis will be the last release that supports Python 2 and Python 3.5.\n``0.18.0`` will be Python 3.6+.\n\n0.17.1 (2020-06-20)\n+++++++++++++++++++\n\n- Django ``Model`` meta class support\n- Django Manager support (completion on Managers/QuerySets)\n- Added Django Stubs to Jedi, thanks to all contributors of the\n  `Django Stubs <https://github.com/typeddjango/django-stubs>`_ project\n- Added ``SyntaxError.get_message``\n- Python 3.9 support\n- Bugfixes (mostly towards Generics)\n\n0.17.0 (2020-04-14)\n+++++++++++++++++++\n\n- Added ``Project`` support. This allows a user to specify which folders Jedi\n  should work with.\n- Added support for Refactoring. The following refactorings have been\n  implemented: ``Script.rename``, ``Script.inline``,\n  ``Script.extract_variable`` and ``Script.extract_function``.\n- Added ``Script.get_syntax_errors`` to display syntax errors in the current\n  script.\n- Added code search capabilities both for individual files and projects. The\n  new functions are ``Project.search``, ``Project.complete_search``,\n  ``Script.search`` and ``Script.complete_search``.\n- Added ``Script.help`` to make it easier to display a help window to people.\n  Now returns pydoc information as well for Python keywords/operators.  This\n  means that on the class keyword it will now return the docstring of Python's\n  builtin function ``help('class')``.\n- The API documentation is now way more readable and complete. Check it out\n  under https://jedi.readthedocs.io. A lot of it has been rewritten.\n- Removed Python 3.4 support\n- Many bugfixes\n\nThis is likely going to be the last minor version that supports Python 2 and\nPython3.5. Bugfixes will be provided in 0.17.1+. The next minor/major version\nwill probably be Jedi 1.0.0.\n\n0.16.0 (2020-01-26)\n+++++++++++++++++++\n\n- **Added** ``Script.get_context`` to get information where you currently are.\n- Completions/type inference of **Pytest fixtures**.\n- Tensorflow, Numpy and Pandas completions should now be about **4-10x faster**\n  after the first time they are used.\n- Dict key completions are working now. e.g. ``d = {1000: 3}; d[10`` will\n  expand to ``1000``.\n- Completion for \"proxies\" works now. These are classes that have a\n  ``__getattr__(self, name)`` method that does a ``return getattr(x, name)``.\n  after loading them initially.\n- Goto on a function/attribute in a class now goes to the definition in its\n  super class.\n- Big **Script API Changes**:\n    - The line and column parameters of ``jedi.Script`` are now deprecated\n    - ``completions`` deprecated, use ``complete`` instead\n    - ``goto_assignments`` deprecated, use ``goto`` instead\n    - ``goto_definitions`` deprecated, use ``infer`` instead\n    - ``call_signatures`` deprecated, use ``get_signatures`` instead\n    - ``usages`` deprecated, use ``get_references`` instead\n    - ``jedi.names`` deprecated, use ``jedi.Script(...).get_names()``\n- ``BaseName.goto_assignments`` renamed to ``BaseName.goto``\n- Add follow_imports to ``Name.goto``. Now its signature matches\n  ``Script.goto``.\n- **Python 2 support deprecated**. For this release it is best effort. Python 2\n  has reached the end of its life and now it's just about a smooth transition.\n  Bugs for Python 2 will not be fixed anymore and a third of the tests are\n  already skipped.\n- Removed ``settings.no_completion_duplicates``. It wasn't tested and nobody\n  was probably using it anyway.\n- Removed ``settings.use_filesystem_cache`` and\n  ``settings.additional_dynamic_modules``, they have no usage anymore. Pretty\n  much nobody was probably using them.\n\n0.15.2 (2019-12-20)\n+++++++++++++++++++\n\n- Signatures are now detected a lot better\n- Add fuzzy completions with ``Script(...).completions(fuzzy=True)``\n- Files bigger than one MB (about 20kLOC) get cropped to avoid getting\n  stuck completely.\n- Many small Bugfixes\n- A big refactoring around contexts/values\n\n0.15.1 (2019-08-13)\n+++++++++++++++++++\n\n- Small bugfix and removal of a print statement\n\n0.15.0 (2019-08-11)\n+++++++++++++++++++\n\n- Added file path completions, there's a **new** ``Completion.type`` now:\n  ``path``. Example: ``'/ho`` -> ``'/home/``\n- ``*args``/``**kwargs`` resolving. If possible Jedi replaces the parameters\n  with the actual alternatives.\n- Better support for enums/dataclasses\n- When using Interpreter, properties are now executed, since a lot of people\n  have complained about this. Discussion in #1299, #1347.\n\nNew APIs:\n\n- ``Name.get_signatures() -> List[Signature]``. Signatures are similar to\n  ``CallSignature``. ``Name.params`` is therefore deprecated.\n- ``Signature.to_string()`` to format signatures.\n- ``Signature.params -> List[ParamName]``, ParamName has the\n  following additional attributes ``infer_default()``, ``infer_annotation()``,\n  ``to_string()``, and ``kind``.\n- ``Name.execute() -> List[Name]``, makes it possible to infer\n  return values of functions.\n\n\n0.14.1 (2019-07-13)\n+++++++++++++++++++\n\n- CallSignature.index should now be working a lot better\n- A couple of smaller bugfixes\n\n0.14.0 (2019-06-20)\n+++++++++++++++++++\n\n- Added ``goto_*(prefer_stubs=True)`` as well as ``goto_*(prefer_stubs=True)``\n- Stubs are used now for type inference\n- Typeshed is used for better type inference\n- Reworked Name.full_name, should have more correct return values\n\n0.13.3 (2019-02-24)\n+++++++++++++++++++\n\n- Fixed an issue with embedded Python, see https://github.com/davidhalter/jedi-vim/issues/870\n\n0.13.2 (2018-12-15)\n+++++++++++++++++++\n\n- Fixed a bug that led to Jedi spawning a lot of subprocesses.\n\n0.13.1 (2018-10-02)\n+++++++++++++++++++\n\n- Bugfixes, because tensorflow completions were still slow.\n\n0.13.0 (2018-10-02)\n+++++++++++++++++++\n\n- A small release. Some bug fixes.\n- Remove Python 3.3 support. Python 3.3 support has been dropped by the Python\n  foundation.\n- Default environments are now using the same Python version as the Python\n  process. In 0.12.x, we used to load the latest Python version on the system.\n- Added ``include_builtins`` as a parameter to usages.\n- ``goto_assignments`` has a new ``follow_builtin_imports`` parameter that\n  changes the previous behavior slightly.\n\n0.12.1 (2018-06-30)\n+++++++++++++++++++\n\n- This release forces you to upgrade parso. If you don't, nothing will work\n  anymore. Otherwise changes should be limited to bug fixes. Unfortunately Jedi\n  still uses a few internals of parso that make it hard to keep compatibility\n  over multiple releases. Parso >=0.3.0 is going to be needed.\n\n0.12.0 (2018-04-15)\n+++++++++++++++++++\n\n- Virtualenv/Environment support\n- F-String Completion/Goto Support\n- Cannot crash with segfaults anymore\n- Cleaned up import logic\n- Understand async/await and autocomplete it (including async generators)\n- Better namespace completions\n- Passing tests for Windows (including CI for Windows)\n- Remove Python 2.6 support\n\n0.11.1 (2017-12-14)\n+++++++++++++++++++\n\n- Parso update - the caching layer was broken\n- Better usages - a lot of internal code was ripped out and improved.\n\n0.11.0 (2017-09-20)\n+++++++++++++++++++\n\n- Split Jedi's parser into a separate project called ``parso``.\n- Avoiding side effects in REPL completion.\n- Numpy docstring support should be much better.\n- Moved the `settings.*recursion*` away, they are no longer usable.\n\n0.10.2 (2017-04-05)\n+++++++++++++++++++\n\n- Python Packaging sucks. Some files were not included in 0.10.1.\n\n0.10.1 (2017-04-05)\n+++++++++++++++++++\n\n- Fixed a few very annoying bugs.\n- Prepared the parser to be factored out of Jedi.\n\n0.10.0 (2017-02-03)\n+++++++++++++++++++\n\n- Actual semantic completions for the complete Python syntax.\n- Basic type inference for ``yield from`` PEP 380.\n- PEP 484 support (most of the important features of it). Thanks Claude! (@reinhrst)\n- Added ``get_line_code`` to ``Name`` and ``Completion`` objects.\n- Completely rewritten the type inference engine.\n- A new and better parser for (fast) parsing diffs of Python code.\n\n0.9.0 (2015-04-10)\n++++++++++++++++++\n\n- The import logic has been rewritten to look more like Python's. There is now\n  an ``InferState.modules`` import cache, which resembles ``sys.modules``.\n- Integrated the parser of 2to3. This will make refactoring possible. It will\n  also be possible to check for error messages (like compiling an AST would give)\n  in the future.\n- With the new parser, the type inference also completely changed. It's now\n  simpler and more readable.\n- Completely rewritten REPL completion.\n- Added ``jedi.names``, a command to do static analysis. Thanks to that\n  sourcegraph guys for sponsoring this!\n- Alpha version of the linter.\n\n\n0.8.1 (2014-07-23)\n+++++++++++++++++++\n\n- Bugfix release, the last release forgot to include files that improve\n  autocompletion for builtin libraries. Fixed.\n\n0.8.0 (2014-05-05)\n+++++++++++++++++++\n\n- Memory Consumption for compiled modules (e.g. builtins, sys) has been reduced\n  drastically. Loading times are down as well (it takes basically as long as an\n  import).\n- REPL completion is starting to become usable.\n- Various small API changes. Generally this release focuses on stability and\n  refactoring of internal APIs.\n- Introducing operator precedence, which makes calculating correct Array\n  indices and ``__getattr__`` strings possible.\n\n0.7.0 (2013-08-09)\n++++++++++++++++++\n\n- Switched from LGPL to MIT license.\n- Added an Interpreter class to the API to make autocompletion in REPL\n  possible.\n- Added autocompletion support for namespace packages.\n- Add sith.py, a new random testing method.\n\n0.6.0 (2013-05-14)\n++++++++++++++++++\n\n- Much faster parser with builtin part caching.\n- A test suite, thanks @tkf.\n\n0.5 versions (2012)\n+++++++++++++++++++\n\n- Initial development.\n\n\n",
