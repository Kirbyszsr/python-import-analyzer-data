If it does not exist, the testsuite can also use the temporary\n``session`` collection, as provided by the GNOME Keyring.\n\nThen, run the Python unittest module::\n\n   python3 -m unittest discover -s tests\n\nIf you want to run the tests in an isolated or headless environment, run\nthis command in a D-Bus session::\n\n   dbus-run-session -- python3 -m unittest discover -s tests\n\nGet the code\n============\n\nSecretStorage is available under BSD license.
