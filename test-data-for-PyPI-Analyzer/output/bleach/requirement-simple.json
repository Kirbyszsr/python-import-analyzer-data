If you find\nyourself jumping through hoops to allow your site administrators to do lots of\nthings, you're probably outside the use cases. Either trust those users, or\ndon't.\n\nBecause it relies on html5lib_, Bleach is as good as modern browsers at dealing\nwith weird, quirky HTML fragments. And *any* of Bleach's methods will fix\nunbalanced or mis-nested tags.\n\nThe version on GitHub_ is the most up-to-date and contains the latest bug\nfixes. You can find full documentation on `ReadTheDocs`_.\n\n:Code:           https://github.com/mozilla/bleach\n:Documentation:  https://bleach.readthedocs.io/\n:Issue tracker:  https://github.com/mozilla/bleach/issues\n:License:        Apache License v2; see LICENSE file\n\n\nReporting Bugs\n==============\n\nFor regular bugs, please report them `in our issue tracker\n<https://github.com/mozilla/bleach/issues>`_.\n\nIf you believe that you've found a security vulnerability, please `file a secure\nbug report in our bug tracker\n<https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?assigned_to=nobody%40mozilla.org&product=Webtools&component=Bleach-security&groups=webtools-security>`_\nor send an email to *security AT mozilla DOT org*.\n\nFor more information on security-related bug disclosure and the PGP key to use\nfor sending encrypted mail or to verify responses received from that address,\nplease read our wiki page at\n`<https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/security/#For_Developers>`_.\n\n\nSecurity\n========\n\nBleach is a security-focused library.\n\nWe have a responsible security vulnerability reporting process.

For example,\n  ``bleach.clean(..., attributes={'a': ['style']})``.\n\n  This issue was confirmed in Bleach versions v3.1.3, v3.1.2, v3.1.1,\n  v3.1.0, v3.0.0, v2.1.4, and v2.1.3. Earlier versions used a similar\n  regular expression and should be considered vulnerable too.\n\n  Anyone using Bleach <=v3.1.3 is encouraged to upgrade.\n\n  https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1623633\n\n**Backwards incompatible changes**\n\n* Style attributes with dashes, or single or double quoted values are\n  cleaned instead of passed through.\n\n**Features**\n\nNone\n\n**Bug fixes**\n\nNone\n\nVersion 3.1.3 (March 17th, 2020)\n--------------------------------\n\n**Security fixes**\n\nNone\n\n**Backwards incompatible changes**\n\nNone\n\n**Features**\n\n* Add relative link to code of conduct.

Earlier\n  versions are likely affected too.\n\n  Anyone using Bleach <=v3.1.1 is encouraged to upgrade.\n\n  https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1621692\n\n**Backwards incompatible changes**\n\nNone\n\n**Features**\n\nNone\n\n**Bug fixes**\n\nNone\n\nVersion 3.1.1 (February 13th, 2020)\n-----------------------------------\n\n**Security fixes**\n\n* ``bleach.clean`` behavior parsing ``noscript`` tags did not match\n  browser behavior.\n\n  Calls to ``bleach.clean`` allowing ``noscript`` and one or more of\n  the raw text tags (``title``, ``textarea``, ``script``, ``style``,\n  ``noembed``, ``noframes``, ``iframe``, and ``xmp``) were vulnerable\n  to a mutation XSS.\n\n  This security issue was confirmed in Bleach versions v2.1.4, v3.0.2,\n  and v3.1.0. Earlier versions are probably affected too.\n\n  Anyone using Bleach <=v3.1.0 is highly encouraged to upgrade.\n\n  https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1615315\n\n**Backwards incompatible changes**\n\nNone\n\n**Features**\n\nNone\n\n**Bug fixes**\n\nNone\n\nBleach changes\n==============\n\nVersion 3.1.0 (January 9th, 2019)\n---------------------------------\n\n**Security fixes**\n\nNone\n\n**Backwards incompatible changes**\n\nNone\n\n**Features**\n\n* Add ``recognized_tags`` argument to the linkify ``Linker`` class. This\n  fixes issues when linkifying on its own and having some tags get escaped.\n  It defaults to a list of HTML5 tags. Thank you, Chad Birch! (#409)\n\n**Bug fixes**\n\n* Add ``six>=1.9`` to requirements. Thank you, Dave Shawley (#416)\n\n* Fix cases where attribute names could have invalid characters in them.\n  (#419)\n\n* Fix problems with ``LinkifyFilter`` not being able to match links\n  across ``&amp;``. (#422)\n\n* Fix ``InputStreamWithMemory`` when the ``BleachHTMLParser`` is\n  parsing ``meta`` tags. (#431)\n\n* Fix doctests. (#357)\n\n\nVersion 3.0.2 (October 11th, 2018)\n----------------------------------\n\n**Security fixes**\n\nNone\n\n**Backwards incompatible changes**\n\nNone\n\n**Features**\n\nNone\n\n**Bug fixes**\n\n* Merge ``Characters`` tokens after sanitizing them. This fixes issues in the\n  ``LinkifyFilter`` where it was only linkifying parts of urls. (#374)\n\n\nVersion 3.0.1 (October 9th, 2018)\n---------------------------------\n\n**Security fixes**\n\nNone\n\n**Backwards incompatible changes**\n\nNone\n\n**Features**\n\n* Support Python 3.7. It supported Python 3.7 just fine, but we added 3.7 to\n  the list of Python environments we test so this is now officially supported.\n  (#377)\n\n**Bug fixes**\n\n* Fix ``list`` object has no attribute ``lower`` in ``clean``. (#398)\n* Fix ``abbr`` getting escaped in ``linkify``. (#400)\n\n\nVersion 3.0.0 (October 3rd, 2018)\n---------------------------------\n\n**Security fixes**\n\nNone\n\n**Backwards incompatible changes**\n\n* A bunch of functions were moved from one module to another.\n\n  These were moved from ``bleach.sanitizer`` to ``bleach.html5lib_shim``:\n\n  * ``convert_entity``\n  * ``convert_entities``\n  * ``match_entity``\n  * ``next_possible_entity``\n  * ``BleachHTMLSerializer``\n  * ``BleachHTMLTokenizer``\n  * ``BleachHTMLParser``\n\n  These functions and classes weren't documented and aren't part of the\n  public API, but people read code and might be using them so we're\n  considering it an incompatible API change.\n\n  If you're using them, you'll need to update your code.\n\n**Features**\n\n* Bleach no longer depends on html5lib. html5lib==1.0.1 is now vendored into\n  Bleach. You can remove it from your requirements file if none of your other\n  requirements require html5lib.\n\n  This means Bleach will now work fine with other libraries that depend on\n  html5lib regardless of what version of html5lib they require. (#386)\n\n**Bug fixes**\n\n* Fixed tags getting added when using clean or linkify. This was a\n  long-standing regression from the Bleach 2.0 rewrite. (#280, #392)\n\n* Fixed ``<isindex>`` getting replaced with a string. Now it gets escaped or\n  stripped depending on whether it's in the allowed tags or not. (#279)\n\n\nVersion 2.1.4 (August 16th, 2018)\n---------------------------------\n\n**Security fixes**\n\nNone\n\n**Backwards incompatible changes**\n\n* Dropped support for Python 3.3. (#328)\n\n**Features**\n\nNone\n\n**Bug fixes**\n\n* Handle ambiguous ampersands in correctly. (#359)\n\n\nVersion 2.1.3 (March 5th, 2018)\n-------------------------------\n\n**Security fixes**\n\n* Attributes that have URI values weren't properly sanitized if the\n  values contained character entities. Using character entities, it\n  was possible to construct a URI value with a scheme that was not\n  allowed that would slide through unsanitized.\n\n  This security issue was introduced in Bleach 2.1. Anyone using\n  Bleach 2.1 is highly encouraged to upgrade.\n\n  https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1442745\n\n**Backwards incompatible changes**\n\nNone\n\n**Features**\n\nNone\n\n**Bug fixes**\n\n* Fixed some other edge cases for attribute URI value sanitizing and\n  improved testing of this code.\n\n\nVersion 2.1.2 (December 7th, 2017)\n----------------------------------\n\n**Security fixes**\n\nNone\n\n**Backwards incompatible changes**\n\nNone\n\n**Features**\n\nNone\n\n**Bug fixes**\n\n* Support html5lib-python 1.0.1.

(#324)\n\n\nVersion 2.1 (September 28th, 2017)\n----------------------------------\n\n**Security fixes**\n\n* Convert control characters (backspace particularly) to \"?\" preventing\n  malicious copy-and-paste situations. (#298)\n\n  See `<https://github.com/mozilla/bleach/issues/298>`_ for more details.\n\n  This affects all previous versions of Bleach. Check the comments on that\n  issue for ways to alleviate the issue if you can't upgrade to Bleach 2.1.\n\n\n**Backwards incompatible changes**\n\n* Redid versioning. ``bleach.VERSION`` is no longer available. Use the string\n  version at ``bleach.__version__`` and parse it with\n  ``pkg_resources.parse_version``. (#307)\n\n* clean, linkify: linkify and clean should only accept text types; thank you,\n  Janusz! (#292)\n\n* clean, linkify: accept only unicode or utf-8-encoded str (#176)\n\n\n**Features**\n\n\n**Bug fixes**\n\n* ``bleach.clean()`` no longer unescapes entities including ones that are missing\n  a ``;`` at the end which can happen in urls and other places. (#143)\n\n* linkify: fix http links inside of mailto links; thank you, sedrubal! (#300)\n\n* clarify security policy in docs (#303)\n\n* fix dependency specification for html5lib 1.0b8, 1.0b9, and 1.0b10; thank you,\n  Zolt\u00e1n! (#268)\n\n* add Bleach vs. html5lib comparison to README; thank you, Stu Cox! (#278)\n\n* fix KeyError exceptions on tags without href attr; thank you, Alex Defsen!\n  (#273)\n\n* add test website and scripts to test ``bleach.clean()`` output in browser;\n  thank you, Greg Guthe!\n\n\nVersion 2.0 (March 8th, 2017)\n-----------------------------\n\n**Security fixes**\n\n* None\n\n\n**Backwards incompatible changes**\n\n* Removed support for Python 2.6. #206\n\n* Removed support for Python 3.2. #224\n\n* Bleach no longer supports html5lib < 0.99999999 (8 9s).\n\n  This version is a rewrite to use the new sanitizing API since the old\n  one was dropped in html5lib 0.99999999 (8 9s).\n\n  If you're using 0.9999999 (7 9s) upgrade to 0.99999999 (8 9s) or higher.\n\n  If you're using 1.0b8 (equivalent to 0.9999999 (7 9s)), upgrade to 1.0b9\n  (equivalent to 0.99999999 (8 9s)) or higher.\n\n* ``bleach.clean`` and friends were rewritten\n\n  ``clean`` was reimplemented as an html5lib filter and happens at a different\n  step in the HTML parsing -> traversing -> serializing process. Because of\n  that, there are some differences in clean's output as compared with previous\n  versions.\n\n  Amongst other things, this version will add end tags even if the tag in\n  question is to be escaped.\n\n* ``bleach.clean`` and friends attribute callables now take three arguments:\n  tag, attribute name and attribute value. Previously they only took attribute\n  name and attribute value.\n\n  All attribute callables will need to be updated.\n\n* ``bleach.linkify`` was rewritten\n\n  ``linkify`` was reimplemented as an html5lib Filter. As such, it no longer\n  accepts a ``tokenizer`` argument.\n\n  The callback functions for adjusting link attributes now takes a namespaced\n  attribute.\n\n  Previously you'd do something like this::\n\n      def check_protocol(attrs, is_new):\n          if not attrs.get('href', '').startswith('http:', 'https:')):\n              return None\n          return attrs\n\n  Now it's more like this::\n\n      def check_protocol(attrs, is_new):\n          if not attrs.get((None, u'href'), u'').startswith(('http:', 'https:')):\n              #            ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n              return None\n          return attrs\n\n  Further, you need to make sure you're always using unicode values. If you\n  don't then html5lib will raise an assertion error that the value is not\n  unicode.\n\n  All linkify filters will need to be updated.\n\n* ``bleach.linkify`` and friends had a ``skip_pre`` argument--that's been\n  replaced with a more general ``skip_tags`` argument.\n\n  Before, you might do::\n\n      bleach.linkify(some_text, skip_pre=True)\n\n  The equivalent with Bleach 2.0 is::\n\n      bleach.linkify(some_text, skip_tags=['pre'])\n\n  You can skip other tags, too, like ``style`` or ``script`` or other places\n  where you don't want linkification happening.\n\n  All uses of linkify that use ``skip_pre`` will need to be updated.\n\n\n**Changes**\n\n* Supports Python 3.6.\n\n* Supports html5lib >= 0.99999999 (8 9s).\n\n* There's a ``bleach.sanitizer.Cleaner`` class that you can instantiate with your\n  favorite clean settings for easy reuse.\n\n* There's a ``bleach.linkifier.Linker`` class that you can instantiate with your\n  favorite linkify settings for easy reuse.\n\n* There's a ``bleach.linkifier.LinkifyFilter`` which is an htm5lib filter that\n  you can pass as a filter to ``bleach.sanitizer.Cleaner`` allowing you to clean\n  and linkify in one pass.\n\n* ``bleach.clean`` and friends can now take a callable as an attributes arg value.\n\n* Tons of bug fixes.\n\n* Cleaned up tests.\n\n* Documentation fixes.\n\n\nVersion 1.5 (November 4th, 2016)\n--------------------------------\n\n**Security fixes**\n\n* None\n\n**Backwards incompatible changes**\n\n* clean: The list of ``ALLOWED_PROTOCOLS`` now defaults to http, https and\n  mailto.\n\n  Previously it was a long list of protocols something like ed2k, ftp, http,\n  https, irc, mailto, news, gopher, nntp, telnet, webcal, xmpp, callto, feed,\n  urn, aim, rsync, tag, ssh, sftp, rtsp, afs, data. #149\n\n**Changes**\n\n* clean: Added ``protocols`` to arguments list to let you override the list of\n  allowed protocols. Thank you, Andreas Malecki! #149\n\n* linkify: Fix a bug involving periods at the end of an email address. Thank you,\n  Lorenz Schori! #219\n\n* linkify: Fix linkification of non-ascii ports. Thank you Alexandre, Macabies!\n  #207\n\n* linkify: Fix linkify inappropriately removing node tails when dropping nodes.\n  #132\n\n* Fixed a test that failed periodically. #161\n\n* Switched from nose to py.test. #204\n\n* Add test matrix for all supported Python and html5lib versions. #230\n\n* Limit to html5lib ``>=0.999,!=0.9999,!=0.99999,<0.99999999`` because 0.9999\n  and 0.99999 are busted.\n\n* Add support for ``python setup.py test``. #97\n\n\nVersion 1.4.3 (May 23rd, 2016)\n------------------------------\n\n**Security fixes**\n\n* None\n\n**Changes**\n\n* Limit to html5lib ``>=0.999,<0.99999999`` because of impending change to\n  sanitizer api. #195\n\n\nVersion 1.4.2 (September 11, 2015)\n----------------------------------\n\n**Changes**\n\n* linkify: Fix hang in linkify with ``parse_email=True``. #124\n\n* linkify: Fix crash in linkify when removing a link that is a first-child. #136\n\n* Updated TLDs.\n\n* linkify: Don't remove exterior brackets when linkifying. #146\n\n\nVersion 1.4.1 (December 15, 2014)\n---------------------------------\n\n**Changes**\n\n* Consistent order of attributes in output.\n\n* Python 3.4 support.\n\n\nVersion 1.4 (January 12, 2014)\n------------------------------\n\n**Changes**\n\n* linkify: Update linkify to use etree type Treewalker instead of simpletree.\n\n* Updated html5lib to version ``>=0.999``.\n\n* Update all code to be compatible with Python 3 and 2 using six.\n\n* Switch to Apache License.\n\n\nVersion 1.3\n-----------\n\n* Used by Python 3-only fork.\n\n\nVersion 1.2.2 (May 18, 2013)\n----------------------------\n\n* Pin html5lib to version 0.95 for now due to major API break.\n\n\nVersion 1.2.1 (February 19, 2013)\n---------------------------------\n\n* ``clean()`` no longer considers ``feed:`` an acceptable protocol due to\n  inconsistencies in browser behavior.\n\n\nVersion 1.2 (January 28, 2013)\n------------------------------\n\n* ``linkify()`` has changed considerably. Many keyword arguments have been\n  replaced with a single callbacks list. Please see the documentation for more\n  information.\n\n* Bleach will no longer consider unacceptable protocols when linkifying.\n\n* ``linkify()`` now takes a tokenizer argument that allows it to skip\n  sanitization.\n\n* ``delinkify()`` is gone.\n\n* Removed exception handling from ``_render``. ``clean()`` and ``linkify()`` may\n  now throw.\n\n* ``linkify()`` correctly ignores case for protocols and domain names.\n\n* ``linkify()`` correctly handles markup within an <a> tag.\n\n\nVersion 1.1.5\n-------------\n\n\nVersion 1.1.4\n-------------\n\n\nVersion 1.1.3 (July 10, 2012)\n-----------------------------\n\n* Fix parsing bare URLs when parse_email=True.\n\n\nVersion 1.1.2 (June 1, 2012)\n----------------------------\n\n* Fix hang in style attribute sanitizer.
