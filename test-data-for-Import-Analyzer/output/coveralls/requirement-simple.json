This\npackage provides seamless integration with `coverage.py`_ (and thus ``pytest``,\n``nosetests``, etc...) in your Python projects::\n\n    pip install coveralls\n    coverage run --source=mypkg -m pytest tests/\n    coveralls\n\nFor more information and usage instructions, see our `documentation`_.\n\nVersion Compatibility\n---------------------\n\nAs of version 2.0, we have dropped support for end-of-life'd versions of Python\nand particularly old version of coverage. Support for non-EOL'd environments is\nprovided on a best-effort basis and will generally be removed once they make\nmaintenance too difficult.\n\nIf you're running on an outdated environment with a new enough package manager\nto support version checks (see `the PyPA docs`_), then installing the latest\ncompatible version should do the trick. If you're even more outdated than that,\nplease pin to ``coveralls<2``.\n\nIf you're in an outdated environment and experiencing an issue, feel free to\nopen a ticket -- but please mention your environment! I'm willing to backport\nfixes to the 1.x branch if need be.\n\n.. _Docs: http://coveralls-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/\n.. _coverage.py: https://coverage.readthedocs.io/en/latest/\n.. _coveralls.io: https://coveralls.io/\n.. _documentation: http://coveralls-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/\n.. _the PyPA docs: https://packaging.python.org/guides/distributing-packages-using-setuptools/#python-requires\n\n\n",
