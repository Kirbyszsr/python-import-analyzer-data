By using it, you agree to cede\ncontrol over minutiae of hand-formatting. In return, _Black_ gives you speed,\ndeterminism, and freedom from `pycodestyle` nagging about formatting. You will save time\nand mental energy for more important matters.\n\nBlackened code looks the same regardless of the project you're reading. Formatting\nbecomes transparent after a while and you can focus on the content instead.\n\n_Black_ makes code review faster by producing the smallest diffs possible.\n\nTry it out now using the [Black Playground](https://black.vercel.app). Watch the\n[PyCon 2019 talk](https://youtu.be/esZLCuWs_2Y) to learn more.\n\n---\n\n**[Read the documentation on ReadTheDocs!](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable)**\n\n---\n\n## Installation and usage\n\n### Installation\n\n_Black_ can be installed by running `pip install black`. It requires Python 3.6.2+ to\nrun. If you want to format Python 2 code as well, install with\n`pip install black[python2]`.\n\nIf you can't wait for the latest _hotness_ and want to install from GitHub, use:\n\n`pip install git+git://github.com/psf/black`\n\n### Usage\n\nTo get started right away with sensible defaults:\n\n```sh\nblack {source_file_or_directory}\n```\n\nYou can run _Black_ as a package if running it as a script doesn't work:\n\n```sh\npython -m black {source_file_or_directory}\n```\n\nFurther information can be found in our docs:\n\n- [Usage and Configuration](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/usage_and_configuration/index.html)\n\n### NOTE: This is a beta product\n\n_Black_ is already [successfully used](https://github.com/psf/black#used-by) by many\nprojects, small and big. Black has a comprehensive test suite, with efficient parallel\ntests, and our own auto formatting and parallel Continuous Integration runner. However,\n_Black_ is still beta. Things will probably be wonky for a while. This is made explicit\nby the \"Beta\" trove classifier, as well as by the \"b\" in the version number. What this\nmeans for you is that **until the formatter becomes stable, you should expect some\nformatting to change in the future**. That being said, no drastic stylistic changes are\nplanned, mostly responses to bug reports.\n\nAlso, as a safety measure which slows down processing, _Black_ will check that the\nreformatted code still produces a valid AST that is effectively equivalent to the\noriginal (see the\n[Pragmatism](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/the_black_code_style/current_style.html#ast-before-and-after-formatting)\nsection for details). If you're feeling confident, use `--fast`.\n\n## The _Black_ code style\n\n_Black_ is a PEP 8 compliant opinionated formatter. _Black_ reformats entire files in\nplace. Style configuration options are deliberately limited and rarely added. It doesn't\ntake previous formatting into account (see [Pragmatism](#pragmatism) for exceptions).\n\nOur documentation covers the current _Black_ code style, but planned changes to it are\nalso documented. They're both worth taking a look:\n\n- [The _Black_ Code Style: Current style](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/the_black_code_style/current_style.html)\n- [The _Black_ Code Style: Future style](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/the_black_code_style/future_style.html)\n\nPlease refer to this document before submitting an issue. What seems like a bug might be\nintended behaviour.\n\n### Pragmatism\n\nEarly versions of _Black_ used to be absolutist in some respects. They took after its\ninitial author. This was fine at the time as it made the implementation simpler and\nthere were not many users anyway. Not many edge cases were reported. As a mature tool,\n_Black_ does make some exceptions to rules it otherwise holds.\n\n- [The _Black_ code style: Pragmatism](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/the_black_code_style/current_style.html#pragmatism)\n\nPlease refer to this document before submitting an issue just like with the document\nabove. What seems like a bug might be intended behaviour.\n\n## Configuration\n\n_Black_ is able to read project-specific default values for its command line options\nfrom a `pyproject.toml` file. This is especially useful for specifying custom\n`--include` and `--exclude`/`--force-exclude`/`--extend-exclude` patterns for your\nproject.\n\nYou can find more details in our documentation:\n\n- [The basics: Configuration via a file](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/usage_and_configuration/the_basics.html#configuration-via-a-file)\n\nAnd if you're looking for more general configuration documentation:\n\n- [Usage and Configuration](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/usage_and_configuration/index.html)\n\n**Pro-tip**: If you're asking yourself \"Do I need to configure anything?\" the answer is\n\"No\". _Black_ is all about sensible defaults. Applying those defaults will have your\ncode in compliance with many other _Black_ formatted projects.\n\n## Used by\n\nThe following notable open-source projects trust _Black_ with enforcing a consistent\ncode style: pytest, tox, Pyramid, Django Channels, Hypothesis, attrs, SQLAlchemy,\nPoetry, PyPA applications (Warehouse, Bandersnatch, Pipenv, virtualenv), pandas, Pillow,\nevery Datadog Agent Integration, Home Assistant, Zulip.\n\nThe following organizations use _Black_: Facebook, Dropbox, Mozilla, Quora.\n\nAre we missing anyone? Let us know.\n\n## Testimonials\n\n**Dusty Phillips**,\n[writer](https://smile.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss?url=search-alias%3Daps&field-keywords=dusty+phillips):\n\n> _Black_ is opinionated so you don't have to be.\n\n**Hynek Schlawack**, [creator of `attrs`](https://www.attrs.org/), core developer of\nTwisted and CPython:\n\n> An auto-formatter that doesn't suck is all I want for Xmas!\n\n**Carl Meyer**, [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) core developer:\n\n> At least the name is good.\n\n**Kenneth Reitz**, creator of [`requests`](http://python-requests.org/) and\n[`pipenv`](https://readthedocs.org/projects/pipenv/):\n\n> This vastly improves the formatting of our code.

It moved to its own file.\n\nSee [CHANGES](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/latest/change_log.html).\n\n## Authors\n\nThe author list is quite long nowadays, so it lives in its own file.\n\nSee [AUTHORS.md](./AUTHORS.md)\n\n## Code of Conduct\n\nEveryone participating in the _Black_ project, and in particular in the issue tracker,\npull requests, and social media activity, is expected to treat other people with respect\nand more generally to follow the guidelines articulated in the\n[Python Community Code of Conduct](https://www.python.org/psf/codeofconduct/).\n\nAt the same time, humor is encouraged. In fact, basic familiarity with Monty Python's\nFlying Circus is expected. We are not savages.\n\nAnd if you _really_ need to slap somebody, do it with a fish while dancing.\n\n\n# Change Log\n\n## 21.5b1\n\n### _Black_\n\n- Refactor `src/black/__init__.py` into many files (#2206)\n\n### Documentation\n\n- Replaced all remaining references to the\n  [`master`](https://github.com/psf/black/tree/main) branch with the\n  [`main`](https://github.com/psf/black/tree/main) branch. Some additional changes in\n  the source code were also made. (#2210)\n- Sigificantly reorganized the documentation to make much more sense. Check them out by\n  heading over to [the stable docs on RTD](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).\n  (#2174)\n\n## 21.5b0\n\n### _Black_\n\n- Set `--pyi` mode if `--stdin-filename` ends in `.pyi` (#2169)\n- Stop detecting target version as Python 3.9+ with pre-PEP-614 decorators that are\n  being called but with no arguments (#2182)\n\n### _Black-Primer_\n\n- Add `--no-diff` to black-primer to suppress formatting changes (#2187)\n\n## 21.4b2\n\n### _Black_\n\n- Fix crash if the user configuration directory is inaccessible. (#2158)\n\n- Clarify\n  [circumstances](https://github.com/psf/black/blob/master/docs/the_black_code_style.md#pragmatism)\n  in which _Black_ may change the AST (#2159)\n\n- Allow `.gitignore` rules to be overridden by specifying `exclude` in `pyproject.toml`\n  or on the command line. (#2170)\n\n### _Packaging_\n\n- Install `primer.json` (used by `black-primer` by default) with black. (#2154)\n\n## 21.4b1\n\n### _Black_\n\n- Fix crash on docstrings ending with \"\\\\ \". (#2142)\n\n- Fix crash when atypical whitespace is cleaned out of dostrings (#2120)\n\n- Reflect the `--skip-magic-trailing-comma` and `--experimental-string-processing` flags\n  in the name of the cache file. Without this fix, changes in these flags would not take\n  effect if the cache had already been populated. (#2131)\n\n- Don't remove necessary parentheses from assignment expression containing assert /\n  return statements. (#2143)\n\n### _Packaging_\n\n- Bump pathspec to >= 0.8.1 to solve invalid .gitignore exclusion handling\n\n## 21.4b0\n\n### _Black_\n\n- Fixed a rare but annoying formatting instability created by the combination of\n  optional trailing commas inserted by `Black` and optional parentheses looking at\n  pre-existing \"magic\" trailing commas. This fixes issue #1629 and all of its many many\n  duplicates. (#2126)\n\n- `Black` now processes one-line docstrings by stripping leading and trailing spaces,\n  and adding a padding space when needed to break up \"\"\"\". (#1740)\n\n- `Black` now cleans up leading non-breaking spaces in comments (#2092)\n\n- `Black` now respects `--skip-string-normalization` when normalizing multiline\n  docstring quotes (#1637)\n\n- `Black` no longer removes all empty lines between non-function code and decorators\n  when formatting typing stubs. Now `Black` enforces a single empty line. (#1646)\n\n- `Black` no longer adds an incorrect space after a parenthesized assignment expression\n  in if/while statements (#1655)\n\n- Added `--skip-magic-trailing-comma` / `-C` to avoid using trailing commas as a reason\n  to split lines (#1824)\n\n- fixed a crash when PWD=/ on POSIX (#1631)\n\n- fixed \"I/O operation on closed file\" when using --diff (#1664)\n\n- Prevent coloured diff output being interleaved with multiple files (#1673)\n\n- Added support for PEP 614 relaxed decorator syntax on python 3.9 (#1711)\n\n- Added parsing support for unparenthesized tuples and yield expressions in annotated\n  assignments (#1835)\n\n- added `--extend-exclude` argument (PR #2005)\n\n- speed up caching by avoiding pathlib (#1950)\n\n- `--diff` correctly indicates when a file doesn't end in a newline (#1662)\n\n- Added `--stdin-filename` argument to allow stdin to respect `--force-exclude` rules\n  (#1780)\n\n- Lines ending with `fmt: skip` will now be not formatted (#1800)\n\n- PR #2053: Black no longer relies on typed-ast for Python 3.8 and higher\n\n- PR #2053: Python 2 support is now optional, install with\n  `python3 -m pip install black[python2]` to maintain support.\n\n- Exclude `venv` directory by default (#1683)\n\n- Fixed \"Black produced code that is not equivalent to the source\" when formatting\n  Python 2 docstrings (#2037)\n\n### _Packaging_\n\n- Self-contained native _Black_ binaries are now provided for releases via GitHub\n  Releases (#1743)\n\n## 20.8b1\n\n### _Packaging_\n\n- explicitly depend on Click 7.1.2 or newer as `Black` no longer works with versions\n  older than 7.0\n\n## 20.8b0\n\n### _Black_\n\n- re-implemented support for explicit trailing commas: now it works consistently within\n  any bracket pair, including nested structures (#1288 and duplicates)\n\n- `Black` now reindents docstrings when reindenting code around it (#1053)\n\n- `Black` now shows colored diffs (#1266)\n\n- `Black` is now packaged using 'py3' tagged wheels (#1388)\n\n- `Black` now supports Python 3.8 code, e.g. star expressions in return statements\n  (#1121)\n\n- `Black` no longer normalizes capital R-string prefixes as those have a\n  community-accepted meaning (#1244)\n\n- `Black` now uses exit code 2 when specified configuration file doesn't exit (#1361)\n\n- `Black` now works on AWS Lambda (#1141)\n\n- added `--force-exclude` argument (#1032)\n\n- removed deprecated `--py36` option (#1236)\n\n- fixed `--diff` output when EOF is encountered (#526)\n\n- fixed `# fmt: off` handling around decorators (#560)\n\n- fixed unstable formatting with some `# type: ignore` comments (#1113)\n\n- fixed invalid removal on organizing brackets followed by indexing (#1575)\n\n- introduced `black-primer`, a CI tool that allows us to run regression tests against\n  existing open source users of Black (#1402)\n\n- introduced property-based fuzzing to our test suite based on Hypothesis and\n  Hypothersmith (#1566)\n\n- implemented experimental and disabled by default long string rewrapping (#1132),\n  hidden under a `--experimental-string-processing` flag while it's being worked on;\n  this is an undocumented and unsupported feature, you lose Internet points for\n  depending on it (#1609)\n\n### Vim plugin\n\n- prefer virtualenv packages over global packages (#1383)\n\n## 19.10b0\n\n- added

(#133)\n\n- fixed missing splits of ternary expressions (#141)\n\n## 18.4a2\n\n- fixed parsing of unaligned standalone comments (#99, #112)\n\n- fixed placement of dictionary unpacking inside dictionary literals (#111)\n\n- Vim plugin now works on Windows, too\n\n- fixed unstable formatting when encountering unnecessarily escaped quotes in a string\n  (#120)\n\n## 18.4a1\n\n- added `--quiet` (#78)\n\n- added automatic parentheses management (#4)\n\n- added [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com) integration (#103, #104)\n\n- fixed reporting on `--check` with multiple files (#101, #102)\n\n- fixed removing backslash escapes from raw strings (#100, #105)\n\n## 18.4a0\n\n- added `--diff` (#87)\n\n- add line breaks before all delimiters, except in cases like commas, to better comply\n  with PEP 8 (#73)\n\n- standardize string literals to use double quotes (almost) everywhere (#75)\n\n- fixed handling of standalone comments within nested bracketed expressions; _Black_\n  will no longer produce super long lines or put all standalone comments at the end of\n  the expression (#22)\n\n- fixed 18.3a4 regression: don't crash and burn on empty lines with trailing whitespace\n  (#80)\n\n- fixed 18.3a4 regression: `# yapf: disable` usage as trailing comment would cause\n  _Black_ to not emit the rest of the file (#95)\n\n- when CTRL+C is pressed while formatting many files, _Black_ no longer freaks out with\n  a flurry of asyncio-related exceptions\n\n- only allow up to two empty lines on module level and only single empty lines within\n  functions (#74)\n\n## 18.3a4\n\n- `# fmt: off` and `# fmt: on` are implemented (#5)\n\n- automatic detection of deprecated Python 2 forms of print statements and exec\n  statements in the formatted file (#49)\n\n- use proper spaces for complex expressions in default values of typed function\n  arguments (#60)\n\n- only return exit code 1 when --check is used (#50)\n\n- don't remove single trailing commas from square bracket indexing (#59)\n\n- don't omit whitespace if the previous factor leaf wasn't a math operator (#55)\n\n- omit extra space in kwarg unpacking if it's the first argument (#46)\n\n- omit extra space in\n  [Sphinx auto-attribute comments](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/ext/autodoc.html#directive-autoattribute)\n  (#68)\n\n## 18.3a3\n\n- don't remove single empty lines outside of bracketed expressions (#19)\n\n- added ability to pipe formatting from stdin to stdin (#25)\n\n- restored ability to format code with legacy usage of `async` as a name (#20, #42)\n\n- even better handling of numpy-style array indexing (#33, again)\n\n## 18.3a2\n\n- changed positioning of binary operators to occur at beginning of lines instead of at\n  the end, following\n  [a recent change to PEP 8](https://github.com/python/peps/commit/c59c4376ad233a62ca4b3a6060c81368bd21e85b)\n  (#21)\n\n- ignore empty bracket pairs while splitting. This avoids very weirdly looking\n  formattings (#34, #35)\n\n- remove a trailing comma if there is a single argument to a call\n\n- if top level functions were separated by a comment, don't put four empty lines after\n  the upper function\n\n- fixed unstable formatting of newlines with imports\n\n- fixed unintentional folding of post scriptum standalone comments into last statement\n  if it was a simple statement (#18, #28)\n\n- fixed missing space in numpy-style array indexing (#33)\n\n- fixed spurious space after star-based unary expressions (#31)\n\n## 18.3a1\n\n- added `--check`\n\n- only put trailing commas in function signatures and calls if it's safe to do so. If\n  the file is Python 3.6+ it's always safe, otherwise only safe if there are no `*args`\n  or `**kwargs` used in the signature or call. (#8)\n\n- fixed invalid spacing of dots in relative imports (#6, #13)\n\n- fixed invalid splitting after comma on unpacked variables in for-loops (#23)\n\n- fixed spurious space in parenthesized set expressions (#7)\n\n- fixed spurious space after opening parentheses and in default arguments (#14, #17)\n\n- fixed spurious space after unary operators when the operand was a complex expression\n  (#15)\n\n## 18.3a0\n\n- first published version, Happy \ud83c\udf70 Day 2018!\n\n- alpha quality\n\n- date-versioned (see: <https://calver.org/>)\n\n\n",
