Alternatively,\nthe Qtconsole installation with pip needs additional steps since pip doesn't install\nthe Qt requirement.\n\n### Install using conda\nTo install:\n\n    conda install qtconsole\n\n**Note:** If the Qtconsole is installed using conda, it will **automatically**\ninstall the Qt requirement as well.\n\n### Install using pip\nTo install:\n\n    pip install qtconsole\n\n**Note:** Make sure that Qt is installed. Unfortunately, Qt is not\ninstalled when using pip. The next section gives instructions on doing it.\n\n### Installing Qt (if needed)\nYou can install PyQt5 with pip using the following command:\n\n    pip install pyqt5\n\nor with a system package manager on Linux. For Windows, PyQt binary packages may be\nused.\n\n**Note:** Additional information about using a system package manager may be\nfound in the [qtconsole documentation](https://qtconsole.readthedocs.io).\n\nMore installation instructions for PyQt can be found in the [PyQt5 documentation](http://pyqt.sourceforge.net/Docs/PyQt5/installation.html) and [PyQt4 documentation](http://pyqt.sourceforge.net/Docs/PyQt4/installation.html)\n\nSource packages for Windows/Linux/MacOS can be found here: [PyQt5](https://www.riverbankcomputing.com/software/pyqt/download5) and [PyQt4](https://riverbankcomputing.com/software/pyqt/download).\n\n\n## Usage\nTo run the Qtconsole:\n\n    jupyter qtconsole\n\n## Resources\n- [Project Jupyter website](https://jupyter.org)\n- Documentation for the Qtconsole\n  * [latest version](https://qtconsole.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) [[PDF](https://media.readthedocs.org/pdf/qtconsole/latest/qtconsole.pdf)]\n  * [stable version](https://qtconsole.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) [[PDF](https://media.readthedocs.org/pdf/qtconsole/stable/qtconsole.pdf)]\n- [Documentation for Project Jupyter](https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) [[PDF](https://media.readthedocs.org/pdf/jupyter/latest/jupyter.pdf)]\n- [Issues](https://github.com/jupyter/qtconsole/issues)\n- [Technical support - Jupyter Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/jupyter)\n\n\n",
