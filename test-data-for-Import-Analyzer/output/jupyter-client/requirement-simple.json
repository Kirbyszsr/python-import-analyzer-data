The limited instructions below for setting up a development environment are for your convenience.\n\n## Coding\n\nYou'll need Python and `pip` on the search path. Clone the Jupyter Client git repository to your computer, for example in `/my/project/jupyter_client`.\nNow create an [editable install](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/reference/pip_install/#editable-installs)\nand download the dependencies of code and test suite by executing:\n\n    cd /my/projects/jupyter_client/\n    pip install -e .[test]\n    py.test\n\nThe last command runs the test suite to verify the setup. During development, you can pass filenames to `py.test`, and it will execute only those tests.\n\n## Documentation\n\nThe documentation of Jupyter Client is generated from the files in `docs/` using Sphinx. Instructions for setting up Sphinx with a selection of optional modules are in the [Documentation Guide](https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contributing/docs-contributions/index.html). You'll also need the `make` command.\nFor a minimal Sphinx installation to process the Jupyter Client docs, execute:\n\n    pip install ipykernel sphinx sphinx_rtd_theme\n\nThe following commands build the documentation in HTML format and check for broken links:\n\n    cd /my/projects/jupyter_client/docs/\n    make html linkcheck\n\nPoint your browser to the following URL to access the generated documentation:\n\n_file:///my/projects/jupyter\\_client/docs/\\_build/html/index.html_\n\n\n\n",
