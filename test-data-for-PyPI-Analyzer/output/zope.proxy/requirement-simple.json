It also proxies all the\ninternal slots (such as ``__int__``/``__str__``/``__add__``).\n\nComplete documentation is at https://zopeproxy.readthedocs.io\n\n\n=========\n Changes\n=========\n\n4.3.5 (2020-03-16)\n==================\n\n- Stop installing C header files on PyPy (which is what zope.proxy before 4.3.4\n  used to do), fixes `issue 39\n  <https://github.com/zopefoundation/zope.proxy/issues/39>`_.\n\n\n4.3.4 (2020-03-13)\n==================\n\n- Fix a compilation warning on Python 3.8. The slot ``tp_print``\n  changed to ``tp_vectorcall_offset`` in 3.8 and must not be set.\n  Prior to 3.8, it was reserved and ignored in all Python 3 versions.\n  See `issue 36\n  <https://github.com/zopefoundation/zope.proxy/issues/36>`_.\n\n- Remove deprecated use of setuptools features.  See `issue 38\n  <https://github.com/zopefoundation/zope.proxy/issues/38>`_.\n\n\n4.3.3 (2019-11-11)\n==================\n\n- Add support for Python 3.8.\n\n- Drop support for Python 3.4.\n\n\n4.3.2 (2019-07-12)\n==================\n\n- Fix error handling in ``ProxyBase.__setattr__``: any the exception raised by\n  ``PyString_AsString``/``PyUnicode_AsUTF8`` would be silently swallowed up\n  and ignored.  See `issue 31\n  <https://github.com/zopefoundation/zope.proxy/issues/31>`_.\n\n\n4.3.1 (2018-08-09)\n==================\n\n- Simplify the internal C handling of attribute names in\n  ``__getattribute__`` and ``__setattr__``.\n\n- Make building the C extension optional. We still attempt to build it\n  on supported platforms, but we allow it to fail in case of a missing\n  compiler or headers. See `issue 26\n  <https://github.com/zopefoundation/zope.proxy/issues/26>`_.\n\n- Test the PURE_PYTHON environment and PyPy3 on Travis CI.\n\n- Add support for Python 3.7.\n\n4.3.0 (2017-09-13)\n==================\n\n- Fix a potential rare crash when deallocating proxies. See `issue 20\n  <https://github.com/zopefoundation/zope.proxy/issues/20>`_.\n\n- Drop support for Python 3.3.\n\n- Drop support for \"python setup.py test\".\n\n- 100% test coverage.\n\n- Fix indexing pure-Python proxies with slices under Python 3, and\n  restore the use of ``__getslice__`` (if implemented by the target's\n  type) under Python 2. Previously, pure-Python proxies would fail\n  with an AttributeError when given a slice on Python 3, and on Python\n  2, a custom ``__getslice__`` was ignored. See `issue 21\n  <https://github.com/zopefoundation/zope.proxy/issues/21>`_.\n\n4.2.1 (2017-04-23)\n==================\n\n- Make the pure-Python implementation of ``sameProxiedObjects`` handle\n  ``zope.security`` proxies. See `issue 15 <https://github.com/zopefoundation/zope.proxy/issues/15>`_.\n\n- Add support for Python 3.6.\n\n4.2.0 (2016-05-05)\n==================\n\n- Correctly strip ``zope.security`` proxies in ``removeAllProxies``.\n  See `issue 13 <https://github.com/zopefoundation/zope.proxy/pull/13>`_.\n\n- Avoid poisoning the user's global wheel cache when testing ``PURE_PYTHON``\n  environments under ``tox``,\n\n- Drop support for Python 2.6 and 3.2.\n\n- Add support for Python 3.5.\n\n4.1.6 (2015-06-02)\n==================\n\n- Make subclasses of ProxyBase properly delegate ``__module__`` to the\n  wrapped object. This fixes some ``zope.interface`` lookups under\n  PyPy.\n\n- Make the pure-Python implementation of ProxyBase properly report the\n  ``zope.interface`` interfaces implemented by builtin types like\n  ``list``. This fixes some ``zope.interface`` lookups under PyPy.\n\n4.1.5 (2015-05-19)\n==================\n\n- Make the C implementation proxy ``__unicode__`` correctly.\n\n- Make the C implementation use the standard methods to proxy ``int`` and\n  ``float``.\n\n- Make the pure Python implementation handle descriptors defined in\n  subclasses like the C version. See\n  https://github.com/zopefoundation/zope.proxy/issues/5.\n\n4.1.4 (2014-03-19)\n==================\n\n- Add support for Python 3.4.\n\n- Update ``bootstrap.py`` to version 2.2.\n\n4.1.3 (2013-03-12)\n==================\n\n- Fix interface object introspection in PyPy. For some reason PyPy makes\n  attributes available despite the restrictive ``__slots__`` declaration.\n\n- Add a bunch of tests surrounding interface lookup and adaptation.\n\n4.1.2 (2013-03-11)\n==================\n\n- Make ``PyProxyBase.__iter__()`` return the result of\n  ``PyProxyBase._wrapped.__iter__`` if available, otherwise falling back to\n  Python internals. The previous implementation always created a generator.\n\n- In ``PyProxyBase.__setattr__()``, allow setting of properties on the\n  proxy itself. This is needed to properly allow proxy extensions as was\n  evidenced int he ``zope.security.decorator`` module.\n\n4.1.1 (2012-12-31)\n==================\n\n- Fleshed out PyPI Trove classifiers.\n\n4.1.0 (2012-12-19)\n==================\n\n- Enable compilation of dependent modules under Py3k.\n\n- Replace use of ``PyCObject`` APIs with equivalent ``PyCapsule`` APIs,\n  except under Python 2.6.\n\n  N.B.  This change is an ABI incompatibility under Python 2.7:\n        extensions built under Python 2.7 against 4.0.x versions of\n        ``zope.proxy`` must be rebuilt.\n\n4.0.1 (2012-11-21)\n==================\n\n- Add support for Python 3.3.\n\n4.0.0 (2012-06-06)\n==================\n\n- Add support for PyPy.\n\n  N.B.:  the C extension is *not* built under PyPy.\n\n- Add a pure-Python reference / fallback implementations of\n  ``zope.proxy.ProxyBase`` and the proxy module API functions.\n\n  N.B.:  the pure-Python proxy implements all regular features of\n  ``ProxyBase``;  however, it does not exclude access to the wrapped object\n  in the same way that the C version does.  If you need that information\n  hiding (e.g., to implement security sandboxing), you still need to use\n  the C version.\n\n- Add support for continuous integration using ``tox`` and ``jenkins``.\n\n- 100% unit test coverage.\n\n- Add Sphinx documentation:  moved doctest examples to API reference.\n\n- Add 'setup.py docs' alias (installs ``Sphinx`` and dependencies).\n\n- Add 'setup.py dev' alias (runs ``setup.py develop`` plus installs\n  ``nose`` and ``coverage``).\n\n- Replace deprecated ``zope.interface.implements`` usage with equivalent\n  ``zope.interface.implementer`` decorator.\n\n- Drop support for Python 2.4 and 2.5.\n\n- Add Python 3.2 support.\n\n3.6.1 (2010-07-06)\n==================\n\n- Make tests compatible with Python 2.7.\n\n3.6.0 (2010-04-30)\n==================\n\n- Remove test extra and the remaining dependency on zope.testing.\n\n- Remove use of 'zope.testing.doctestunit' in favor of stdlib's 'doctest.\n\n3.5.0 (2009/01/31)\n==================\n\n- Add support to bootstrap on Jython.\n\n- Use ``zope.container`` instead of ``zope.app.container``.\n\n3.4.2 (2008/07/27)\n==================\n\n- Make C code compatible with Python 2.5 on 64bit architectures.\n\n3.4.1 (2008/06/24)\n==================\n\n- Bug: Update ``setup.py`` script to conform to common layout. Also updated\n  some of the fields.\n\n- Bug: Honor pre-cooked indices for tuples and lists in the ``__getslice__()``\n  and ``__setslice__()`` methods. See\n  http://docs.python.org/ref/sequence-methods.html.\n\n3.4.0 (2007/07/12)\n==================\n\n- Feature: Add a ``decorator`` module that supports declaring interfaces on\n  proxies that get blended with the interfaces of the things they proxy.\n\n3.3.0 (2006/12/20)\n==================\n\n- Corresponds to the verison of the ``zope.proxy`` package shipped as part of\n  the Zope 3.3.0 release.\n\n\n3.2.0 (2006/01/05)\n==================\n\n- Corresponds to the verison of the ``zope.proxy`` package shipped as part of\n  the Zope 3.2.0 release.\n\n\n3.0.0 (2004/11/07)\n==================\n\n- Corresponds to the verison of the ``zope.proxy`` package shipped as part of\n  the Zope X3.0.0 release.",
