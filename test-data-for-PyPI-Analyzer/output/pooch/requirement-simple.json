Are you shipping them with the code?\nAre they getting too big?*\n\nPooch is here to help! It will manage a data *registry* by downloading your data files\nfrom a server only when needed and storing them locally in a data *cache* (a folder on\nyour computer).\n\nHere are Pooch's main features:\n\n* Pure Python and minimal dependencies.\n* Download a file only if necessary (it's not in the data cache or needs to be updated).\n* Verify download integrity through SHA256 hashes (also used to check if a file needs to\n  be updated).\n* Designed to be extended: plug in custom download (FTP, scp, etc) and post-processing\n  (unzip, decompress, rename) functions.\n* Includes utilities to unzip/decompress the data upon download to save loading time.\n* Can handle basic HTTP authentication (for servers that require a login) and printing\n  download progress bars.\n* Easily set up an environment variable to overwrite the data cache location.\n\n*Are you a scientist or researcher? Pooch can help you too!*\n\n* Automatically download your data files so you don't have to keep them in your GitHub\n  repository.\n* Make sure everyone running the code has the same version of the data files (enforced\n  through the SHA256 hashes).\n\n\nExample\n-------\n\nFor a **scientist downloading a data file** for analysis:\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    from pooch import retrieve\n\n\n    # Download the file and save it locally. Running this again will not cause\n    # a download. Pooch will check the hash (checksum) of the downloaded file\n    # against the given value to make sure it's the right file (not corrupted\n    # or outdated).\n    fname = retrieve(\n        url=\"https://some-data-server.org/a-data-file.nc\",\n        known_hash=\"md5:70e2afd3fd7e336ae478b1e740a5f08e\",\n    )\n\n\nFor **package developers** including sample data in their projects:\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    \"\"\"\n    Module mypackage/datasets.py\n    \"\"\"\n    import pkg_resources\n    import pandas\n    import pooch\n\n    # Get the version string from your project.

The registry file should be packaged\n    # and distributed with your software.\n    GOODBOY.load_registry(\n        pkg_resources.resource_stream(\"mypackage\", \"registry.txt\")\n    )\n\n\n    # Define functions that your users can call to get back the data in memory\n    def fetch_gravity_data():\n        \"\"\"\n        Load some sample gravity data to use in your docs.\n        \"\"\"\n        # Fetch the path to a file in the local storage.
