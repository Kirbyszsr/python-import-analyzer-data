  "description": "Purpose\n========\n\nThis package contains the code from importlib as found in Python 2.7. It is\nprovided so that people who wish to use ``importlib.import_module()`` with a\nversion of Python prior to 2.7 or in 3.0 have the function readily available.\nThe code in no way deviates from what can be found in the Python 2.7 standard\nlibrary.\n\nFor documentation, see the `importlib docs`_ for Python 2.7.\n\n.. _importlib docs: http://docs.python.org/2.7/library/importlib.html\n\n\nNotice about maintenance\n========================\n\nDue to the fact that this project is only applicable to versions of Python that\nare no `longer supported <http://cpython-devguide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#status-of-python-branches>`_,\nthere will be no further maintenance of this project. Since the code included\nin this project is simply copied from Python 2.7 itself, if you need updated\nfixes you can copy the files manually on your own.",
