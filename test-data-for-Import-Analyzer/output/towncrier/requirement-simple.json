...\n    version = \"1.2.3\"  # project version if maintained separately\n\nTo create a new news fragment, use the ``towncrier create`` command.\nFor example::\n\n    towncrier create 123.feature\n\nTo produce a draft of the news file, run::\n\n    towncrier build --draft\n\nTo produce the news file for real, run::\n\n    towncrier build\n\nThis command will remove the news files (with ``git rm``) and append the built news to the filename specified by the ``filename`` configuration option, and then stage the news file changes (with ``git add``).\nIt leaves committing the changes up to the user.\n\nIf you wish to have content at the top of the news file (for example, to say where you can find the tickets), put your text above a rST comment that says::\n\n  .. towncrier release notes start\n\n``towncrier`` will then put the version notes after this comment, and leave your existing content that was above it where it is.\n\n\nNews Fragments\n--------------\n\n``towncrier`` has a few standard types of news fragments, signified by the file extension.\nThese are:\n\n- ``.feature``: Signifying a new feature.\n- ``.bugfix``: Signifying a bug fix.\n- ``.doc``: Signifying a documentation improvement.\n- ``.removal``: Signifying a deprecation or removal of public API.\n- ``.misc``: A ticket has been closed, but it is not of interest to users.\n\nThe start of the filename is the ticket number, and the content is what will end up in the news file.\nFor example, if ticket #850 is about adding a new widget, the filename would be ``myproject/newsfragments/850.feature`` and the content would be ``myproject.widget has been added``.\n\n\nFurther Options\n---------------\n\nTowncrier has the following global options, which can be specified in the toml file:\n\n.. code-block:: toml\n\n    [tool.towncrier]\n    package = \"\"\n    package_dir = \".\"\n    single_file = true  # if false, filename is formatted like `title_format`.\n    filename = \"NEWS.rst\"\n    directory = \"directory/of/news/fragments\"\n    version = \"1.2.3\"  # project version if maintained separately\n    name = \"arbitrary project name\"\n    template = \"path/to/template.rst\"\n    start_string = \"Text used to detect where to add the generated content in the middle of a file. Generated content added after this text. Newline auto added.\"\n    title_format = \"{name} {version} ({project_date})\"  # or false if template includes title\n    issue_format = \"format string for {issue} (issue is the first part of fragment name)\"\n    underlines = \"=-~\"\n    wrap = false  # Wrap text to 79 characters\n    all_bullets = true  # make all fragments bullet points\n\nIf a single file is used, the content of that file gets overwritten each time.\n\nIf ``title_format`` is unspecified or an empty string, the default format will be used.\nIf set to ``false``, no title will be created.\nThis can be useful if the specified template creates the title itself.\n\nFurthermore, you can add your own fragment types using:\n\n.. code-block:: toml\n\n    [tool.towncrier]\n    [[tool.towncrier.type]]\n    directory = \"deprecation\"\n    name = \"Deprecations\"\n    showcontent = true\n\n\n",
