The report at the end summarizes which `testenvs` have failed and which have succeeded.\n\n**Note:** To learn more about what you can do with tox, have a look at\n[the collection of examples in the documentation](https://tox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples.html) or\n[existing projects using tox](https://github.com/search?l=INI&q=tox.ini+in%3Apath&type=Code).\n\n### How it works\n\ntox creates virtual environments for all configured so-called `testenvs`, it then installs the project and other\nnecessary dependencies and runs the configured set of commands. See\n[system overview](https://tox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#system-overview) for more details.\n\n<a href=\"https://tox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#system-overview\">\n    <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tox-dev/tox/master/docs/img/tox_flow.png\"\n         alt=\"tox flow\"\n         width=\"800px\"\n         align=\"center\">\n</a>\n\n### tox can be used for ...\n\n- creating development environments\n- running static code analysis and test tools\n- automating package builds\n- running tests against the package built by tox\n- checking that packages install correctly with different Python versions/interpreters\n- unifying Continuous Integration and command line based testing\n- building and deploying project documentation\n- releasing a package to PyPI or any other platform\n- limit: your imagination\n\n### Documentation\n\nDocumentation for tox can be found at [Read The Docs](https://tox.readthedocs.org).\n\n### Communication and questions\n\nFor the fastest and interactive feedback please join our\n[![Discord](https://img.shields.io/discord/802911963368783933?style=flat-square)](https://discord.gg/edtj86wzBX) server.\nIf you have questions or suggestions you can first check if they have already been answered or discussed on our\n[issue tracker](https://github.com/tox-dev/tox/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue+sort%3Aupdated-desc+label%3A%22type%3Aquestion+%3Agrey_question%3A%22+).\nOn [Stack Overflow (tagged with `tox`)](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/tox).\n\n### Contributing\n\nContributions are welcome.
