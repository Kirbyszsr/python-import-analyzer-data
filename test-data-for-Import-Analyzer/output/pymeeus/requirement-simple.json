  "description": "PyMeeus\n=======\n\n   **Library of astronomical algorithms in Python**.\n\nPyMeeus is a Python implementation of the astronomical algorithms\ndescribed in the classical book 'Astronomical Algorithms, 2nd Edition,\nWillmann-Bell Inc. (1998)' by Jean Meeus.\n\nThere are great astronomical libraries out there. For instance, if\nyou're looking for high precision and speed you should take a look at\n`libnova <http://libnova.sourceforge.net/>`__. For a set of python\nmodules aimed at professional astronomers, you should look at\n`Astropy <http://www.astropy.org/>`__. On the other hand, the advantages\nof PyMeeus are its simplicity, ease of use, ease of reading, ease of\ninstallation (it has the minimum amount of dependencies) and abundant\ndocumentation.\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nThe easiest way of installing PyMeeus is using pip:\n\n.. code:: sh\n\n   pip install pymeeus\n\nOr, for a per-user installation:\n\n.. code:: sh\n\n   pip install --user pymeeus\n\nIf you prefer Python3, you can use:\n\n.. code:: sh\n\n   pip3 install --user pymeeus\n\nIf you have PyMeeus already installed, but want to upgrade to the latest\nversion:\n\n.. code:: sh\n\n   pip3 install -U pymeeus\n\nMeta\n----\n\nAuthor: Dagoberto Salazar\n\nDistributed under the GNU Lesser General Public License v3 (LGPLv3). See\n``LICENSE.txt`` and ``COPYING.LESSER`` for more information.\n\nDocumentation: https://pymeeus.readthedocs.io/en/latest/\n\nGitHub: https://github.com/architest/pymeeus\n\nIf you have Sphinx installed, you can generate your own, latest\ndocumentation going to directory 'docs' and issuing:\n\n.. code:: sh\n\n   make html\n\nThen the HTML documentation pages can be found in 'build/html'.\n\nContributing\n------------\n\nThe preferred method to contribute is through forking and pull requests:\n\n1. Fork it (https://github.com/architest/pymeeus/fork)\n2. Create your feature branch (``git checkout -b feature/fooBar``)\n3. Commit your changes (``git commit -am 'Add some fooBar'``)\n4. Push to the branch (``git push origin feature/fooBar``)\n5. Create a new Pull Request\n\nPlease bear in mind that PyMeeus follows the PEP8 style guide for Python\ncode `(PEP8) <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/?>`__. We suggest\nyou install and use a linter like\n`Flake8 <http://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/>`__ before contributing.\n\nAdditionally, PyMeeus makes heavy use of automatic tests. As a general\nrule, every function or method added must have a corresponding test in\nthe proper place in ``tests`` directory.\n\nFinally, documentation is also a big thing here. Add proper and abundant\ndocumentation to your new code. This also includes in-line comments!!!.\n\nContributors\n------------\n\n-  `Neil Freeman <https://github.com/fitnr>`__ - Fixed undefined\n   variable in Epoch.tt2ut\n-  `molsen234 <https://github.com/molsen234>`__ - Fixed bug when using\n   fractional seconds, minutes, hours or days\n-  `Sebastian Veigl <https://github.com/sebastian1306>`__ - Added\n   functionality for Jupiter's moons\n-  Sophie Scholz - Added functionality for Jupiter's moons\n-  Vittorio Serra - Added functionality for Jupiter's moons\n-  Michael Lutz - Added functionality for Jupiter's moons\n-  `Ben Dilday <https://github.com/bdilday>`__ - Added ``__hash__()``\n   method to class Epoch\n\nWhat's new\n----------\n\n-  0.5.11\n\n   -  Added parameter ``local`` to the ``Epoch`` class constructor and\n      the methods ``get_date()`` and ``get_full_date()``.\n\n-  0.5.10\n\n   -  Added methods ``moon_librations()`` and\n      ``moon_position_angle_axis()``.\n\n-  0.5.9\n\n   -  Added method ``moon_maximum_declination()``.\n\n-  0.5.8\n\n   -  Fixed several bugs in ``Epoch`` class, and added method ``doy()``.\n\n-  0.5.7\n\n   -  Added method ``moon_passage_nodes()``.\n\n-  0.5.6\n\n   -  Added method ``moon_perigee_apogee()``.\n\n-  0.5.5\n\n   -  Added method ``moon_phase()``.\n\n-  0.5.4\n\n   -  Added methods ``illuminated_fraction_disk()`` and\n      ``position_bright_limb()`` to ``Moon`` class.\n\n-  0.5.3\n\n   -  Fixed error in the return type of method\n      ``Sun.equation_of_time()``.\n\n-  0.5.2\n\n   -  Added methods to compute the Moon's longitude of ascending node\n      and perigee.\n\n-  0.5.1\n\n   -  Changes in the organization of the documentation.\n\n-  0.5.0\n\n   -  Added ``Moon`` class and ``position()`` methods.\n\n-  0.4.3\n\n   -  Added method ``ring_parameters()`` to Saturn class.\n\n-  0.4.2\n\n   -  Added method ``__hash__()`` to Epoch.
