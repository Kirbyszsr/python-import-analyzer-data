  "description": "PickleShare - a small 'shelve' like datastore with concurrency support\n\nLike shelve, a PickleShareDB object acts like a normal dictionary. Unlike shelve,\nmany processes can access the database simultaneously. Changing a value in \ndatabase is immediately visible to other processes accessing the same database.\n\nConcurrency is possible because the values are stored in separate files. Hence\nthe \"database\" is a directory where *all* files are governed by PickleShare.\n\nExample usage::\n\n    from pickleshare import *\n    db = PickleShareDB('~/testpickleshare')\n    db.clear()\n    print(\"Should be empty:\",db.items())\n    db['hello'] = 15\n    db['aku ankka'] = [1,2,313]\n    db['paths/are/ok/key'] = [1,(5,46)]\n    print(db.keys())\n\nThis module is certainly not ZODB, but can be used for low-load\n(non-mission-critical) situations where tiny code size trumps the \nadvanced features of a \"real\" object database.\n\nInstallation guide: pip install pickleshare\n\n\n",
