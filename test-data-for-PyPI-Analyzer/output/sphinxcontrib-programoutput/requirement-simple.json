The former just inserts the output::\n\n   .. program-output:: python -V\n\nOutput::\n\n   Python 2.7.1\n\nThe latter directive mimics a shell session, and is intended to show examples::\n\n   .. command-output:: python -V\n\nOutput::\n\n   $ python -V\n   Python 2.7.1\n\n\nPlease refer to the documentation_ for comprehensive information about usage and\nconfiguration of this extension.\n\n\nDevelopment and Support\n=======================\n\nPlease refer to the documentation_ for information on support and the\ndevelopment process.\n\n\n.. _Sphinx: http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/\n.. _PyPI: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/sphinxcontrib-programoutput\n.. _documentation: http://sphinxcontrib-programoutput.readthedocs.org\n\n\n=========\n Changes\n=========\n\n0.17 (2021-03-31)\n=================\n\n- Add support for Python 3.9.\n\n- Drop support for python 3.5.\n\n- Include program output and current working directory in the warning\n  logged when a program returns an unexpected return code. Suggested\n  by Sorin Sbarnea. See `issue 50\n  <https://github.com/NextThought/sphinxcontrib-programoutput/issues/50>`_.\n\n\n0.16 (2020-03-23)\n=================\n\n- Add ``name`` and ``caption`` options. Added in\n  `PR 41 <https://github.com/NextThought/sphinxcontrib-programoutput/pull/41>`_\n  by Rapha\u00ebl.\n- Add support for Python 3.8.\n\n\n0.15 (2019-09-16)\n=================\n\n- Make the test suite stop assuming the presence of a 'python'\n  executable on the path. Instead it uses ``sys.executable`` (which\n  shouldn't have spaces). Note that it does continue to assume the\n  presence of other executables, such as 'echo'. Reported in `issue 38\n  <https://github.com/NextThought/sphinxcontrib-programoutput/issues/38>`_\n  by John Vandenberg.\n\n\n0.14 (2019-04-08)\n=================\n\n- Add ``python_requires`` metadata to better allow tools like ``pip``\n  to install a correct version.\n\n- Add support for Sphinx 2.0 on Python 3.\n\n- Avoid unicode errors when the program command or output produced\n  non-ASCII output and the configured prompt was a byte string. This\n  was most likely under Python 2, where the default configured prompt\n  is a byte string. Reported by, and patch inspired by, `issue 33\n  <https://github.com/NextThought/sphinxcontrib-programoutput/issues/33>`_\n  by latricewilgus.\n\n0.13 (2018-12-22)\n=================\n\n- Drop support for Sphinx < 1.7.\n\n- Fix tests on Sphinx >= 1.8.0.\n\n- Restore error message into the document by default from failed\n  program runs on Sphinx >= 1.8.0b1.\n\n- Fix deprecation warnings on Sphinx >= 1.8. Reported in `issue 29\n  <https://github.com/NextThought/sphinxcontrib-programoutput/issues/29>`_\n  by miili.\n\n\n0.11 (2017-05-18)\n=================\n\n- Explicitly set ``parallel_read_safe`` to true in the extension\n  metadata. See `issue 25\n  <https://github.com/NextThought/sphinxcontrib-programoutput/issues/25>`_.\n  With thanks to Adam J. Stewart and Stephen McDowell.\n\n0.10 (2017-03-17)\n=================\n\n- Decode output from the program tolerantly, using the 'replace'\n  handler. Based on a `pull request\n  <https://github.com/habnabit/sphinxcontrib-programoutput/commit/592078e0386c2a36d50a6528b6e49d91707138bf>`_\n  by Stefan C. M\u00fcller.\n\n\n0.9 (2017-03-15)\n================\n\n- Forked and revived the project in `Gitub\n  <https://github.com/NextThought/sphinxcontrib-programoutput>`_.\n\n- Run the tests on Travis CI. Formatting and style is enforced by pylint.\n\n- The oldest supported and tested Sphinx version is now 1.3.5. See\n  `issue 17\n  <https://github.com/NextThought/sphinxcontrib-programoutput/issues/17>`_.\n\n\n- Remove support for Python 2.6, Python 3.2 and 3.3.\n\n- 100% test coverage.\n\n- Remove support for ``programoutput_use_ansi``. The\n  ``sphinxcontrib.ansi`` extension is no longer available on PyPI.\n\n0.8 (Oct 12, 2012)\n==================\n\n- Migrated to GitHub\n\n\n0.7 (Apr 17, 2012)\n==================\n\n- Added ``cwd`` option to ``..program-output``\n- Working directory of executed programs defaults to documentation root now\n\n\n0.6 (Jan 07, 2012)\n==================\n\n- Python 3 support\n- Require Sphinx 1.1 now\n\n\n0.5 (Sep 19, 2011)\n==================\n\n- ``programoutput_prompt_template`` is interpreted as format string now!\n- Require Python 2.6 now\n- Added ``returncode`` option to ``program-output`` (thanks to\n  Jan-Marek Glogowski)\n- Support ``returncode`` formatting key in\n  ``programoutput_prompt_template``\n- Warn on unexpected return codes instead of raising\n  ``subprocess.CalledProcessError``\n- Turn fatal errors during command into document error messages\n  instead of crashing the build\n\n\n0.4.1 (Mar 11, 2011)\n====================\n\n- Some source code cleanups\n- Fixed installation instructions in documentation\n\n\n0.4 (May 21, 2010)\n==================\n\n- Initial release\n\n\n",
