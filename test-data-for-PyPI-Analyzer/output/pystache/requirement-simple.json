Mustache\n        is a framework-agnostic, logic-free templating system inspired by\n        `ctemplate <http://code.google.com/p/google-ctemplate/>`__ and\n        `et <http://www.ivan.fomichev.name/2008/05/erlang-template-engine-prototype.html>`__.\n        Like ctemplate, Mustache \"emphasizes separating logic from presentation:\n        it is impossible to embed application logic in this template language.\"\n        \n        The `mustache(5) <http://mustache.github.com/mustache.5.html>`__ man\n        page provides a good introduction to Mustache's syntax. For a more\n        complete (and more current) description of Mustache's behavior, see the\n        official `Mustache spec <https://github.com/mustache/spec>`__.\n        \n        Pystache is `semantically versioned <http://semver.org>`__ and can be\n        found on `PyPI <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pystache>`__. This version\n        of Pystache passes all tests in `version\n        1.1.2 <https://github.com/mustache/spec/tree/v1.1.2>`__ of the spec.\n        \n        Requirements\n        ------------\n        \n        Pystache is tested with--\n        \n        -  Python 2.4 (requires simplejson `version\n           2.0.9 <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/simplejson/2.0.9>`__ or earlier)\n        -  Python 2.5 (requires\n           `simplejson <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/simplejson/>`__)\n        -  Python 2.6\n        -  Python 2.7\n        -  Python 3.1\n        -  Python 3.2\n        -  Python 3.3\n        -  `PyPy <http://pypy.org/>`__\n        \n        `Distribute <http://packages.python.org/distribute/>`__ (the setuptools\n        fork) is recommended over\n        `setuptools <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools>`__, and is required\n        in some cases (e.g. for Python 3 support). If you use\n        `pip <http://www.pip-installer.org/>`__, you probably already satisfy\n        this requirement.\n        \n        JSON support is needed only for the command-line interface and to run\n        the spec tests. We require simplejson for earlier versions of Python\n        since Python's `json <http://docs.python.org/library/json.html>`__\n        module was added in Python 2.6.\n        \n        For Python 2.4 we require an earlier version of simplejson since\n        simplejson stopped officially supporting Python 2.4 in simplejson\n        version 2.1.0. Earlier versions of simplejson can be installed manually,\n        as follows:\n        \n        ::\n        \n            pip install 'simplejson<2.1.0'\n        \n        Official support for Python 2.4 will end with Pystache version 0.6.0.\n        \n        Install It\n        ----------\n        \n        ::\n        \n            pip install pystache\n        \n        And test it--\n        \n        ::\n        \n            pystache-test\n        \n        To install and test from source (e.g. from GitHub), see the Develop\n        section.\n        \n        Use It\n        ------\n        \n        ::\n        \n            >>> import pystache\n            >>> print pystache.render('Hi {{person}}!', {'person': 'Mom'})\n            Hi Mom!\n        \n        You can also create dedicated view classes to hold your view logic.\n        \n        Here's your view class (in .../examples/readme.py):\n        \n        ::\n        \n            class SayHello(object):\n                def to(self):\n                    return \"Pizza\"\n        \n        Instantiating like so:\n        \n        ::\n        \n            >>> from pystache.tests.examples.readme import SayHello\n            >>> hello = SayHello()\n        \n        Then your template, say\\_hello.mustache (by default in the same\n        directory as your class definition):\n        \n        ::\n        \n            Hello, {{to}}!\n        \n        Pull it together:\n        \n        ::\n        \n            >>> renderer = pystache.Renderer()\n            >>> print renderer.render(hello)\n            Hello, Pizza!\n        \n        For greater control over rendering (e.g. to specify a custom template\n        directory), use the ``Renderer`` class like above. One can pass\n        attributes to the Renderer class constructor or set them on a Renderer\n        instance. To customize template loading on a per-view basis, subclass\n        ``TemplateSpec``. See the docstrings of the\n        `Renderer <https://github.com/defunkt/pystache/blob/master/pystache/renderer.py>`__\n        class and\n        `TemplateSpec <https://github.com/defunkt/pystache/blob/master/pystache/template_spec.py>`__\n        class for more information.\n        \n        You can also pre-parse a template:\n        \n        ::\n        \n            >>> parsed = pystache.parse(u\"Hey {{#who}}{{.}}!{{/who}}\")\n            >>> print parsed\n            [u'Hey ', _SectionNode(key=u'who', index_begin=12, index_end=18, parsed=[_EscapeNode(key=u'.'), u'!'])]\n        \n        And then:\n        \n        ::\n        \n            >>> print renderer.render(parsed, {'who': 'Pops'})\n            Hey Pops!\n            >>> print renderer.render(parsed, {'who': 'you'})\n            Hey you!\n        \n        Python 3\n        --------\n        \n        Pystache has supported Python 3 since version 0.5.1. Pystache behaves\n        slightly differently between Python 2 and 3, as follows:\n        \n        -  In Python 2, the default html-escape function ``cgi.escape()`` does\n           not escape single quotes. In Python 3, the default escape function\n           ``html.escape()`` does escape single quotes.\n        -  In both Python 2 and 3, the string and file encodings default to\n           ``sys.getdefaultencoding()``. However, this function can return\n           different values under Python 2 and 3, even when run from the same\n           system. Check your own system for the behavior on your system, or do\n           not rely on the defaults by passing in the encodings explicitly (e.g.\n           to the ``Renderer`` class).\n        \n        Unicode\n        -------\n        \n        This section describes how Pystache handles unicode, strings, and\n        encodings.\n        \n        Internally, Pystache uses `only unicode\n        strings <http://docs.python.org/howto/unicode.html#tips-for-writing-unicode-aware-programs>`__\n        (``str`` in Python 3 and ``unicode`` in Python 2). For input, Pystache\n        accepts both unicode strings and byte strings (``bytes`` in Python 3 and\n        ``str`` in Python 2). For output, Pystache's template rendering methods\n        return only unicode.\n        \n        Pystache's ``Renderer`` class supports a number of attributes to control\n        how Pystache converts byte strings to unicode on input. These include\n        the ``file_encoding``, ``string_encoding``, and ``decode_errors``\n        attributes.\n        \n        The ``file_encoding`` attribute is the encoding the renderer uses to\n        convert to unicode any files read from the file system. Similarly,\n        ``string_encoding`` is the encoding the renderer uses to convert any\n        other byte strings encountered during the rendering process into unicode\n        (e.g. context values that are encoded byte strings).\n        \n        The ``decode_errors`` attribute is what the renderer passes as the\n        ``errors`` argument to Python's built-in unicode-decoding function\n        (``str()`` in Python 3 and ``unicode()`` in Python 2). The valid values\n        for this argument are ``strict``, ``ignore``, and ``replace``.\n        \n        Each of these attributes can be set via the ``Renderer`` class's\n        constructor using a keyword argument of the same name. See the Renderer\n        class's docstrings for further details. In addition, the\n        ``file_encoding`` attribute can be controlled on a per-view basis by\n        subclassing the ``TemplateSpec`` class. When not specified explicitly,\n        these attributes default to values set in Pystache's ``defaults``\n        module.\n        \n        Develop\n        -------\n        \n        To test from a source distribution (without installing)--\n        \n        ::\n        \n            python test_pystache.py\n        \n        To test Pystache with multiple versions of Python (with a single\n        command!), you can use `tox <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/tox>`__:\n        \n        ::\n        \n            pip install 'virtualenv<1.8'  # Version 1.8 dropped support for Python 2.4.\n            pip install 'tox<1.4'  # Version 1.4 dropped support for Python 2.4.\n            tox\n        \n        If you do not have all Python versions listed in ``tox.ini``--\n        \n        ::\n        \n            tox -e py26,py32  # for example\n        \n        The source distribution tests also include doctests and tests from the\n        Mustache spec. To include tests from the Mustache spec in your test\n        runs:\n        \n        ::\n        \n            git submodule init\n            git submodule update\n        \n        The test harness parses the spec's (more human-readable) yaml files if\n        `PyYAML <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/PyYAML>`__ is present. Otherwise,\n        it parses the json files. To install PyYAML--\n        \n        ::\n        \n            pip install pyyaml\n        \n        To run a subset of the tests, you can use\n        `nose <http://somethingaboutorange.com/mrl/projects/nose/0.11.1/testing.html>`__:\n        \n        ::\n        \n            pip install nose\n            nosetests --tests pystache/tests/test_context.py:GetValueTests.test_dictionary__key_present\n        \n        Using Python 3 with Pystache from source\n        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n        \n        Pystache is written in Python 2 and must be converted to Python 3 prior\n        to using it with Python 3. The installation process (and tox) do this\n        automatically.\n        \n        To convert the code to Python 3 manually (while using Python 3)--\n        \n        ::\n        \n            python setup.py build\n        \n        This writes the converted code to a subdirectory called ``build``. By\n        design, Python 3 builds\n        `cannot <https://bitbucket.org/tarek/distribute/issue/292/allow-use_2to3-with-python-2>`__\n        be created from Python 2.\n        \n        To convert the code without using setup.py, you can use\n        `2to3 <http://docs.python.org/library/2to3.html>`__ as follows (two\n        steps)--\n        \n        ::\n        \n            2to3 --write --nobackups --no-diffs --doctests_only pystache\n            2to3 --write --nobackups --no-diffs pystache\n        \n        This converts the code (and doctests) in place.\n        \n        To ``import pystache`` from a source distribution while using Python 3,\n        be sure that you are importing from a directory containing a converted\n        version of the code (e.g. from the ``build`` directory after\n        converting), and not from the original (unconverted) source directory.\n        Otherwise, you will get a syntax error. You can help prevent this by not\n        running the Python IDE from the project directory when importing\n        Pystache while using Python 3.\n        \n        Mailing List\n        ------------\n        \n        There is a `mailing list <http://librelist.com/browser/pystache/>`__.\n        Note that there is a bit of a delay between posting a message and seeing\n        it appear in the mailing list archive.\n        \n        Credits\n        -------\n        \n        ::\n        \n            >>> context = { 'author': 'Chris Wanstrath', 'maintainer': 'Chris Jerdonek' }\n            >>> print pystache.render(\"Author: {{author}}\\nMaintainer: {{maintainer}}\", context)\n            Author: Chris Wanstrath\n            Maintainer: Chris Jerdonek\n        \n        Pystache logo by `David Phillips <http://davidphillips.us/>`__ is\n        licensed under a `Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported\n        License <http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/deed.en_US>`__.\n        |image0|\n        \n        History\n        =======\n        \n        **Note:** Official support for Python 2.4 will end with Pystache version\n        0.6.0.\n        \n        0.5.4 (2014-07-11)\n        ------------------\n        \n        -  Bugfix: made test with filenames OS agnostic (issue #162).\n        \n        0.5.3 (2012-11-03)\n        ------------------\n        \n        -  Added ability to customize string coercion (e.g. to have None render\n           as ``''``) (issue #130).\n        -  Added Renderer.render\\_name() to render a template by name (issue\n           #122).\n        -  Added TemplateSpec.template\\_path to specify an absolute path to a\n           template (issue #41).\n        -  Added option of raising errors on missing tags/partials:\n           ``Renderer(missing_tags='strict')`` (issue #110).\n        -  Added support for finding and loading templates by file name in\n           addition to by template name (issue #127).
