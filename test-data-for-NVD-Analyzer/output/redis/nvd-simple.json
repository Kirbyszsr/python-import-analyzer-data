        "value": "Redis is an open-source, in-memory database that persists on disk. In affected versions of Redis an integer overflow bug in 32-bit Redis version 4.0 or newer could be exploited to corrupt the heap and potentially result with remote code execution. Redis 4.0 or newer uses a configurable limit for the maximum supported bulk input size. By default, it is 512MB which is a safe value for all platforms. If the limit is significantly increased, receiving a large request from a client may trigger several integer overflow scenarios, which would result with buffer overflow and heap corruption. We believe this could in certain conditions be exploited for remote code execution. By default, authenticated Redis users have access to all configuration parameters and can therefore use the \u201cCONFIG SET proto-max-bulk-len\u201d to change the safe default, making the system vulnerable. **This problem only affects 32-bit Redis (on a 32-bit system, or as a 32-bit executable running on a 64-bit system).** The problem is fixed in version 6.2, and the fix is back ported to 6.0.11 and 5.0.11. Make sure you use one of these versions if you are running 32-bit Redis. An additional workaround to mitigate the problem without patching the redis-server executable is to prevent clients from directly executing `CONFIG SET`: Using Redis 6.0 or newer, ACL configuration can be used to block the command. Using older versions, the `rename-command` configuration directive can be used to rename the command to a random string unknown to users, rendering it inaccessible. Please note that this workaround may have an additional impact on users or operational systems that expect `CONFIG SET` to behave in certain ways."

The attack vector is: To exploit the vulnerability, the attacker must upload a malicious ConnectIQ application to the ConnectIQ store. The ConnectIQ program interpreter trusts the string length provided in the data section of the PRG file. It allocates memory for the string immediately, and then copies the string into the TVM object by using a function similar to strcpy. This copy can exceed the length of the allocated string data and overwrite heap data. A successful exploit would allow a ConnectIQ app store application to escape and perform activities outside the restricted application execution environment."

The attack vector is: To exploit the vulnerability, the attacker must upload a malicious ConnectIQ application to the ConnectIQ store. The ConnectIQ program interpreter fails to check the index provided when accessing the local variable in the LGETV and LPUTV instructions. This provides the ability to both read and write memory outside the bounds of the TVM context allocation. It can be leveraged to construct a use-after-free scenario, leading to a constrained read/write primitive across the entire MAX32630 address space.

The attack vector is: To exploit the vulnerability, the attacker must upload a malicious ConnectIQ application to the ConnectIQ store. The ConnectIQ program interpreter trusts the offset provided for the stack value duplication instruction, DUP. The offset is unchecked and memory prior to the start of the execution stack can be read and treated as a TVM object. A successful exploit could use the vulnerability to leak runtime information such as the heap handle or pointer for a number of TVM context variables. Some reachable values may be controlled enough to forge a TVM object on the stack, leading to possible remote code execution."
