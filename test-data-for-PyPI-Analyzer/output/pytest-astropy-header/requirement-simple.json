  "description": "=====================\npytest-astropy-header\n=====================\n\nThis plugin package provides a way to include information about the system,\nPython installation, and select dependencies in the header of the output when\nrunning pytest. It can be used with packages that are not affiliated with the\nAstropy project, but is optimized for use with astropy-related projects.\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nThe ``pytest-astropy-header`` plugin can be installed using ``pip``::\n\n    $ pip install pytest-astropy-header\n\nIt is also possible to install the latest development version from the source\nrepository::\n\n    $ git clone https://github.com/astropy/pytest-astropy-header\n    $ cd pytest-astropy-header\n    $ pip install .\n\nIn either case, the plugin will automatically be registered for use with\n``pytest``.\n\nUser guide\n----------\n\nThe plugin provided by this package makes it easy to include a header\nwith diagnostic information before running the tests, e.g.::\n\n    Running tests in astropy.\n\n    Date: 2019-09-02T23:33:43\n\n    Platform: Darwin-18.7.0-x86_64-i386-64bit\n\n    Executable: /Users/tom/python/dev/bin/python3.7\n\n    Full Python Version:\n    3.7.4 (v3.7.4:e09359112e, Jul  8 2019, 14:54:52)\n    [Clang 6.0 (clang-600.0.57)]\n\n    encodings: sys: utf-8, locale: UTF-8, filesystem: utf-8\n    byteorder: little\n    float info: dig: 15, mant_dig: 15\n\n    Package versions:\n    numpy: 1.16.4\n    scipy: 1.3.0\n    matplotlib: 3.1.1\n    h5py: 2.9.0\n    pandas: 0.24.2\n    astropy: 4.0.dev25634\n\n    Using Astropy options: remote_data: none.\n\nThe most robust way to enable the plugin in a way that will work regardless of\nhow the tests are run (e.g. via ``python setup.py test``, ``pytest``, or\n``package.test()``) is to add the following to a ``conftest.py`` file that is\ninside your package::\n\n    def pytest_configure(config):\n        config.option.astropy_header = True\n\n\nBy default, a few packages will be shown, but you may want to customize how the\npackages appear. As for enabling the plugin, the most robust way to do this to\nbe compatible with different astropy versions is via the ``conftest.py`` file::\n\n    from pytest_astropy_header.display import PYTEST_HEADER_MODULES, TESTED_VERSIONS\n\n    def pytest_configure(config):\n        config.option.astropy_header = True\n        PYTEST_HEADER_MODULES.pop('Pandas')\n        PYTEST_HEADER_MODULES['scikit-image'] = 'skimage'\n\nThe key to ``PYTEST_HEADER_MODULES`` should be the name that will be displayed\nin the header, and the value should be the name of the Python module.\n\nMigrating from the astropy header plugin to pytest-astropy\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\nBefore the v4.0 release of the core astropy package, the plugin that handles the\nheader of the testing output described above lived in\n``astropy.tests.plugins.display``. A few steps are now needed to update packages\nto make sure that only the pytest-astropy version is used instead. These should\nbe done in addition to the configuration mentioned in the previous section.\n\nFirst, you should be able to significantly simplify the ``conftest.py`` file by\nreplacing e.g.::\n\n    from astropy.version import version as astropy_version\n    if astropy_version < '3.0':\n        # With older versions of Astropy, we actually need to import the pytest\n        # plugins themselves in order to make them discoverable by pytest.\n        from astropy.tests.pytest_plugins import *\n    else:\n        # As of Astropy 3.0, the pytest plugins provided by Astropy are\n        # automatically made available when Astropy is installed. This means it's\n        # not necessary to import them here, but we still need to import global\n        # variables that are used for configuration.\n        from astropy.tests.plugins.display import (pytest_report_header,\n                                                   PYTEST_HEADER_MODULES,\n                                                   TESTED_VERSIONS)\n\n    # Customize the following lines to add/remove entries from\n    # the list of packages for which version numbers are displayed when running\n    # the tests. Making it pass for KeyError is essential in some cases when\n    # the package uses other astropy affiliated packages.\n    try:\n        PYTEST_HEADER_MODULES['Astropy'] = 'astropy'\n        del PYTEST_HEADER_MODULES['h5py']\n    except KeyError:\n        pass\n\n    # This is to figure out the package version, rather than\n    # using Astropy's\n    from .version import version, astropy_helpers_version\n\n    packagename = os.path.basename(os.path.dirname(__file__))\n    TESTED_VERSIONS[packagename] = version\n    TESTED_VERSIONS['astropy_helpers'] = astropy_helpers_version\n\nwith e.g.::\n\n    import os\n\n    from astropy.version import version as astropy_version\n    if astropy_version < '3.0':\n        from astropy.tests.pytest_plugins import *\n        del pytest_report_header\n    else:\n        from pytest_astropy_header.display import PYTEST_HEADER_MODULES, TESTED_VERSIONS\n\n\n    def pytest_configure(config):\n\n        config.option.astropy_header = True\n\n        PYTEST_HEADER_MODULES.pop('Pandas', None)\n        PYTEST_HEADER_MODULES['scikit-image'] = 'skimage'\n\n        from .version import version, astropy_helpers_version\n        packagename = os.path.basename(os.path.dirname(__file__))\n        TESTED_VERSIONS[packagename] = version\n        TESTED_VERSIONS['astropy_helpers'] = astropy_helpers_version\n\nNote that while you will need to use a recent version of pytest-astropy for this\nto work, it should work with Astropy 2.0 onwards without requiring all the\n``try...except`` for imports.\n\nNext check all of your ``conftest.py`` files and be sure to remove the old\nplugin from lists such as::\n\n    pytest_plugins = [\n      'astropy.tests.plugins.display',\n    ]\n\nDevelopment Status\n------------------\n\nQuestions, bug reports, and feature requests can be submitted on `github`_.\n\n.. _github: https://github.com/astropy/pytest-astropy\n\nLicense\n-------\n\nThis package is licensed under a 3-clause BSD style license - see the\n``LICENSE.rst`` file.\n\n\n",
