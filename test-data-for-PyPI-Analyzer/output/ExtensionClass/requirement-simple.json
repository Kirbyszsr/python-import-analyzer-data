  "description": "====================================================\n ExtensionClass and ExtensionClass-related packages\n====================================================\n\nExtensionClass\n==============\n\nThis package provides a metaclass that allows classes implemented in\nextension modules to be subclassed in Python.  Unless you need\nExtensionClasses for legacy applications (e.g. Zope), you probably\nwant to use Python's new-style classes (available since Python 2.2).\n\nComputedAttribute\n=================\n\nThis package provides a way to attach attributes to an\n``ExtensionClass`` or instance that are computed by calling a\ncallable.  This works very much like ``property`` known from new-style\nclasses, except that a ``ComputedAttribute`` can also be attached to\nan instance and that it honours ExtensionClass semantics (which is\nuseful for retaining Acquisition wrappers, for example).\n\nMethodObject\n============\n\nThis package lets you attach additional \"methods\" to ExtensionClasses.\nThese \"methods\" are actually implemented by subclassing the\n``MethodObject.Method`` class and implementing the ``__call__`` method\nthere.  Instances of those classes will be bound to the instances\nthey're attached to and will receive that instance object as a first\nparameter (after ``self``).\n\n\n===========\n Changelog\n===========\n\n4.5.0 (2020-10-07)\n==================\n\n- Drop support for Python 3.4.\n\n- Add support for Python 3.8 and 3.9.\n\n- Fix accessing ``__parent__`` when it is defined as a class attribute\n  that is ``None`` (e.g., in subclasses of\n  ``zope.conatiner.contained.Contained``). See `issue 24\n  <https://github.com/zopefoundation/ExtensionClass/issues/24>`_.\n\n4.4.0 (2018-10-05)\n==================\n\n- Fail if C extensions couldn't be compiled on compatible platforms.\n\n- Add Appveyor configuration to automate building Windows eggs\n\n- Add support for Python 3.7.\n\n- Fix getting attributes that are data descriptors in the Python\n  implementation.\n\n- Reach and automatically maintain 100% test coverage.\n\n4.3.0 (2017-02-22)\n==================\n\n- Drop support for Python 3.3.\n\n- Remove unused C macro from ``ExtensionClass.h``.\n\n- Fix C compilation under Windows.\n\n4.2.1 (2017-02-02)\n==================\n\n- Fix problems with computed attribute and property wrapping.\n\n4.2.0 (2017-01-18)\n==================\n\n- Port the C extension to Python 3.\n\n- Add support for Python 3.5 and 3.6.\n\n- Drop support for Python 2.6, 3.2.\n\n4.1.2 (2015-04-03)\n==================\n\n- Fix calling of ``__class_init__`` hook by Python implementation.\n\n4.1.1 (2015-03-20)\n==================\n\n- Avoid wrapping ``__parent__`` in pure-Python version.  Matches\n  change made to C version in afb8488.  See issue #3.\n\n4.1 (2014-12-18)\n================\n\n- Housekeeping changes only.\n\n4.1b1 (2014-11-12)\n==================\n\n- Added compatibility with Python 3.4.\n\n4.1a1 (2013-05-04)\n==================\n\n- Added compatibility with Python 3.2 and 3.3 using the Python reference\n  implementation.\n\n- Add Python reference implementation. Used by default on PyPy.\n\n4.0 (2013-02-24)\n================\n\n- Added trove classifiers to project metadata.\n\n4.0a1 (2011-12-13)\n==================\n\n- Don't create wrappers when retrieving parent pointers.\n\n2.13.2 (2010-06-16)\n===================\n\n- LP #587760: Handle tp_basicsize correctly.\n\n2.13.1 (2010-04-03)\n===================\n\n- Removed undeclared testing dependency on zope.testing.\n\n- Removed cruft in ``pickle/pickle.c`` related to removed ``__getnewargs__``.\n\n2.13.0 (2010-02-22)\n===================\n\n- Avoid defining ``__getnewargs__`` as not to defeat the ZODB persistent\n  reference optimization. Refs https://bugs.launchpad.net/zope2/+bug/143657.\n  In order to take advantage of this optimization, you need to re-save your\n  objects.\n\n2.12.0 (2010-02-14)\n===================\n\n- Removed old build artifacts and some metadata cleanup.\n\n- Added support for method cache in ExtensionClass. Patch contributed by\n  Yoshinori K. Okuji. See https://bugs.launchpad.net/zope2/+bug/486182.\n\n2.11.3 (2009-08-02)\n===================\n\n- Further 64-bit fixes (Python 2.4 compatibility).\n\n2.11.2 (2009-08-02)\n===================\n\n- Fixed 64-bit compatibility issues for Python 2.5.x / 2.6.x.  See\n  http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0353/ for details.\n\n2.11.1 (2009-02-19)\n===================\n\n- Initial egg release.",
