See the\n  instructions in the `Building the docs`_ section for details.\n\nWorkflow to contribute\n======================\n\nTo contribute to joblib, first create an account on `github\n<http://github.com/>`_. Once this is done, fork the `joblib repository\n<http://github.com/joblib/joblib>`_ to have your own repository,\nclone it using 'git clone' on the computers where you want to work. Make\nyour changes in your clone, push them to your github account, test them\non several computers, and when you are happy with them, send a pull\nrequest to the main repository.\n\nRunning the test suite\n======================\n\nTo run the test suite, you need the pytest (version >= 3) and coverage modules.\nRun the test suite using::\n\n    pytest joblib\n\nfrom the root of the project.\n\nBuilding the docs\n=================\n\nTo build the docs you need to have sphinx (>=1.4) and some dependencies\ninstalled::\n\n    pip install -U -r .readthedocs-requirements.txt\n\nThe docs can then be built with the following command::\n\n    make doc\n\nThe html docs are located in the ``doc/_build/html`` directory.\n\n\nMaking a source tarball\n=======================\n\nTo create a source tarball, eg for packaging or distributing, run the\nfollowing command::\n\n    python setup.py sdist\n\nThe tarball will be created in the `dist` directory. This command will\ncompile the docs, and the resulting tarball can be installed with\nno extra dependencies than the Python standard library. You will need\nsetuptool and sphinx.\n\nMaking a release and uploading it to PyPI\n=========================================\n\nThis command is only run by project manager, to make a release, and\nupload in to PyPI::\n\n    python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel\n    twine upload dist/*\n\n\nNote that the documentation should automatically get updated at each git\npush. If that is not the case, try building th doc locally and resolve\nany doc build error (in particular when running the examples).\n\nUpdating the changelog\n======================\n\nChanges are listed in the CHANGES.rst file. They must be manually updated\nbut, the following git command may be used to generate the lines::\n\n    git log --abbrev-commit --date=short --no-merges --sparse\n\nLicensing\n---------\n\njoblib is **BSD-licenced** (3 clause):\n\n    This software is OSI Certified Open Source Software.\n    OSI Certified is a certification mark of the Open Source Initiative.\n\n    Copyright (c) 2009-2011, joblib developpers\n    All rights reserved.\n\n    Redistribution and use in source and binary forms, with or without\n    modification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are met:\n\n    * Redistributions of source code must retain the above copyright notice,\n      this list of conditions and the following disclaimer.\n\n    * Redistributions in binary form must reproduce the above copyright notice,\n      this list of conditions and the following disclaimer in the documentation\n      and/or other materials provided with the distribution.\n\n    * Neither the name of Gael Varoquaux. nor the names of other joblib\n      contributors may be used to endorse or promote products derived from\n      this software without specific prior written permission.\n\n    **This software is provided by the copyright holders and contributors\n    \"as is\" and any express or implied warranties, including, but not\n    limited to, the implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for\n    a particular purpose are disclaimed.
