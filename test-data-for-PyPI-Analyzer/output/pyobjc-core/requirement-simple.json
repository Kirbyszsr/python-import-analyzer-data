  "description": "PyObjC is a bridge between Python and Objective-C.  It allows full\nfeatured Cocoa applications to be written in pure Python.  It is also\neasy to use other frameworks containing Objective-C class libraries\nfrom Python and to mix in Objective-C, C and C++ source.\n\nPython is a highly dynamic programming language with a shallow learning\ncurve.  It combines remarkable power with very clear syntax.\n\nPyObjC also supports full introspection of Objective-C classes and\ndirect invocation of Objective-C APIs from the interactive interpreter.\n\nProject links\n-------------\n\n* `Documentation <https://pyobjc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_\n\n* `Issue Tracker <https://github.com/ronaldoussoren/pyobjc/issues>`_\n\n* `Repository <https://github.com/ronaldoussoren/pyobjc/>`_\n\n\n\n",
