The problem has existed since about 2006 and the issue is also in 4.1.9. If the link is specifically crafted this could lead to untrusted code execution. It is always best practice to be careful opening documents from unknown and unverified sources. The mitigation in Apache OpenOffice 4.1.10 (unreleased) assures that a security warning is displayed giving the user the option of continuing to open the hyperlink."

NOTE: The vendor argue that this CVE is not a vulnerability because it has an inaccurate bug scope and patch links. \u201c1) Inaccurate Bug Scope - The issue scope was on Kong's docker-compose template, and not Kong's docker image itself. In reality, this issue is not associated with any version of the Kong gateway. As such, the description stating \u2018An issue was discovered in docker-kong (for Kong) through 2.0.3.\u2019 is incorrect. This issue only occurs if a user decided to spin up Kong via docker-compose without following the security documentation. The docker-compose template is meant for users to quickly get started with Kong, and is meant for development purposes only. 2) Incorrect Patch Links - The CVE currently points to a documentation improvement as a \u201cPatch\u201d link: https://github.com/Kong/docs.konghq.com/commit/d693827c32144943a2f45abc017c1321b33ff611.This link actually points to an improvement Kong Inc made for fool-proofing. However, instructions for how to protect the admin API were already well-documented here: https://docs.konghq.com/2.0.x/secure-admin-api/#network-layer-access-restrictions , which was first published back in 2017 (as shown in this commit: https://github.com/Kong/docs.konghq.com/commit/e99cf875d875dd84fdb751079ac37882c9972949) Lastly, the hyperlink to https://github.com/Kong/kong (an unrelated Github Repo to this issue) on the Hyperlink list does not include any meaningful information on this topic.\u201d"

The \"send\" command in the airmail:// URL scheme allows an external application to send arbitrary emails from an active account. URL parameters for the \"send\" command with the \"attachment_\" prefix designate attachment parameters. If the value of an attachment parameter corresponds to an accessible file path, the file is attached to the outbound message. In addition, relative file paths are acceptable attachment parameter values. The handler can be invoked using any method that invokes the URL handler such as a hyperlink in an email. The user is not prompted when the handler processes the \"send\" command, thus leading to automatic transmission of an email with designated attachments from the target account to a target address."
