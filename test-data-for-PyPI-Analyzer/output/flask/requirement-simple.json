  "name": "Flask",
  "description": "Flask\n=====\n\nFlask is a lightweight `WSGI`_ web application framework. It is designed\nto make getting started quick and easy, with the ability to scale up to\ncomplex applications. It began as a simple wrapper around `Werkzeug`_\nand `Jinja`_ and has become one of the most popular Python web\napplication frameworks.\n\nFlask offers suggestions, but doesn't enforce any dependencies or\nproject layout. It is up to the developer to choose the tools and\nlibraries they want to use. There are many extensions provided by the\ncommunity that make adding new functionality easy.\n\n\nInstalling\n----------\n\nInstall and update using `pip`_:\n\n.. code-block:: text\n\n    pip install -U Flask\n\n\nA Simple Example\n----------------\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    from flask import Flask\n\n    app = Flask(__name__)\n\n    @app.route(\"/\")\n    def hello():\n        return \"Hello, World!\"\n\n.. code-block:: text\n\n    $ env FLASK_APP=hello.py flask run\n     * Serving Flask app \"hello\"\n     * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)\n\n\nContributing\n------------\n\nFor guidance on setting up a development environment and how to make a\ncontribution to Flask, see the `contributing guidelines`_.\n\n.. _contributing guidelines: https://github.com/pallets/flask/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.rst\n\n\nDonate\n------\n\nThe Pallets organization develops and supports Flask and the libraries\nit uses.
