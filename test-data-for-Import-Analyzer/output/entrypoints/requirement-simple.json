  "description": "Entry points are a way for Python packages to advertise objects with some\ncommon interface. The most common examples are ``console_scripts`` entry points,\nwhich define shell commands by identifying a Python function to run.\n\n*Groups* of entry points, such as ``console_scripts``, point to objects with\nsimilar interfaces. An application might use a group to find its plugins, or\nmultiple groups if it has different kinds of plugins.\n\nThe **entrypoints** module contains functions to find and load entry points.\nYou can install it from PyPI with ``pip install entrypoints``.\n\nTo advertise entry points when distributing a package, see\n`entry_points in the Python Packaging User Guide\n<https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/distributing.html#entry-points>`_.\n",
