  "description": "`typed_ast` is a Python 3 package that provides a Python 2.7 and Python 3\nparser similar to the standard `ast` library.  Unlike `ast`, the parsers in\n`typed_ast` include PEP 484 type comments and are independent of the version of\nPython under which they are run.  The `typed_ast` parsers produce the standard\nPython AST (plus type comments), and are both fast and correct, as they are\nbased on the CPython 2.7 and 3.6 parsers.\n\n",
