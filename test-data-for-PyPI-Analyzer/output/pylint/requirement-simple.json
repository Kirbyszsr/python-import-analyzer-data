Tidelift gives software development teams a single source for\n       purchasing and maintaining their software, with professional grade assurances\n       from the experts who know it best, while seamlessly integrating with existing\n       tools.\n\n.. _Tidelift Subscription: https://tidelift.com/subscription/pkg/pypi-pylint?utm_source=pypi-pylint&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=readme\n\n\n======\nPylint\n======\n\n**It's not just a linter that annoys you!**\n\nPylint is a Python static code analysis tool which looks for programming errors,\nhelps enforcing a coding standard, sniffs for code smells and offers simple refactoring\nsuggestions.\n\nIt's highly configurable, having special pragmas to control its errors and warnings\nfrom within your code, as well as from an extensive configuration file.\nIt is also possible to write your own plugins for adding your own checks or for\nextending pylint in one way or another.\n\nIt's a free software distributed under the GNU General Public Licence unless\notherwise specified.\n\nDevelopment is hosted on GitHub: https://github.com/PyCQA/pylint/\n\nYou can use the code-quality@python.org mailing list to discuss about\nPylint. Subscribe at https://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/code-quality/\nor read the archives at https://mail.python.org/pipermail/code-quality/\n\nPull requests are amazing and most welcome.\n\nInstall\n-------\n\nPylint can be simply installed by running::\n\n    pip install pylint\n\nIf you are using Python 3.6+, upgrade to get full support for your version::\n\n    pip install pylint --upgrade\n\nIf you want to install from a source distribution, extract the tarball and run\nthe following command ::\n\n    python setup.py install\n\n\nDo make sure to do the same for astroid, which is used internally by pylint.\n\nFor debian and rpm packages, use your usual tools according to your Linux distribution.\n\nMore information about installation and available distribution format\ncan be found here_.\n\nDocumentation\n-------------\n\nThe documentation lives at https://pylint.pycqa.org/.\n\nPylint is shipped with following additional commands:\n\n* pyreverse: an UML diagram generator\n* symilar: an independent similarities checker\n* epylint: Emacs and Flymake compatible Pylint\n\n\nTesting\n-------\n\nWe use tox_ and pytest-benchmark_ for running the test suite. You should be able to install it with::\n\n    pip install tox pytest pytest-benchmark\n\n\nTo run the test suite for a particular Python version, you can do::\n\n    tox -e py37\n\n\nTo run individual tests with ``tox``, you can do::\n\n    tox -e py37 -- -k name_of_the_test\n\n\nWe use pytest_ for testing ``pylint``, which you can use without using ``tox`` for a faster development cycle.\n\nIf you want to run tests on a specific portion of the code with pytest_, (pytest-cov_) and your local python version::\n\n    # ( pip install pytest-cov )\n    # Everything:\n    python3 -m pytest tests/\n    # Everything in tests/message with coverage for the relevant code:\n    python3 -m pytest tests/message/ --cov=pylint.message\n    coverage html\n    # Only the functional test \"missing_kwoa_py3\":\n    python3 -m pytest \"tests/test_functional.py::test_functional[missing_kwoa_py3]\"\n\n\nDo not forget to clone astroid_ and install the last version::\n\n\n    git clone https://github.com/PyCQA/astroid.git\n\n    # From source\n    python3 astroid/setup.py build sdist\n    pip3 install astroid/dist/astroid*.tar.gz\n\n    # Using an editable installation\n    cd astroid\n    python3 -m pip install -e .\n\n\nFor more detailed information, check the documentation.\n\n.. _here: https://pylint.pycqa.org/en/latest/user_guide/installation.html\n.. _tox: https://tox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/\n.. _pytest: https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/\n.. _pytest-benchmark: https://pytest-benchmark.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html\n.. _pytest-cov: https://pypi.org/project/pytest-cov/\n.. _astroid: https://github.com/PyCQA/astroid\n\nLicense\n-------\n\npylint is, with a few exceptions listed below, `GPLv2 <https://github.com/PyCQA/pylint/blob/master/LICENSE>`_.\n\nThe icon files are licensed under the `CC BY-SA 4.0 <https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/>`_ license:\n\n- `doc/logo.png <https://github.com/PyCQA/pylint/blob/master/doc/logo.png>`_\n- `doc/logo.svg <https://github.com/PyCQA/pylint/blob/master/doc/logo.svg>`_\n\n\n",
