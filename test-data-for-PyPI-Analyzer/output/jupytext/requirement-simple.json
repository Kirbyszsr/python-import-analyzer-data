Wished you could edit them in your favorite IDE? And get clear and meaningful diffs when doing version control? Then... Jupytext may well be the tool you're looking for!\n\nJupytext is a plugin for Jupyter that can save Jupyter notebooks as either\n- Markdown files (or [MyST Markdown](https://jupytext.readthedocs.io/en/latest/formats.html#myst-markdown) files, or [R Markdown](https://jupytext.readthedocs.io/en/latest/formats.html#r-markdown) documents)\n- Scripts in [many languages](https://jupytext.readthedocs.io/en/latest/languages.html).\n\n## Use cases\n\nCommon [use cases](https://jupytext.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples.html) for Jupytext are:\n- Doing version control on Jupyter Notebooks\n- Editing, merging or refactoring notebooks in your favorite text editor\n- Applying Q&A checks on notebooks.\n\n## Install\n\nYou can install Jupytext with\n- `pip install jupytext`\n- or `conda install jupytext -c conda-forge`.\n\nPlease note that Jupytext includes an extension for Jupyter Lab. In the latest version of Jupytext, this extension is compatible with Jupyter Lab >= 3.0 only. If you use Jupyter Lab 2.x, please either stay with Jupytext 1.8.2, or install, on top of the latest pip or conda version of Jupytext, a version of the extension that is compatible with Jupyter Lab 2.x:\n```\njupyter labextension install jupyterlab-jupytext@1.2.2  # For Jupyter Lab 2.x\n```\n\nThen, restart your Jupyter server (for more installation details, see the [install section](https://jupytext.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html) in the documentation).\n\nWhen Jupytext is installed, `.py` and `.md` files have a notebook icon. And you can really open and run these files as notebooks\n<ul>\n<details>\n  <summary>With a click on the text file in Jupyter Notebook</summary>\n\n[![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mwouts/jupytext-screenshots/master/JupytextDocumentation/TextNotebooks.png)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/mwouts/jupytext/master?filepath=demo)\n(click on the image above to try this on [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/mwouts/jupytext/master?filepath=demo))\n</details>\n<details>\n  <summary>With a right click and <i>open with notebook</i> in Jupyter Lab</summary>\n\n[![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mwouts/jupytext-screenshots/master/JupytextDocumentation/ContextMenuLab.png)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/mwouts/jupytext/master?urlpath=lab/tree/demo/get_started.ipynb)\n(click on the image above to try this on [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/mwouts/jupytext/master?urlpath=lab/tree/demo/get_started.ipynb))\n</details>\n</ul>\n\n## Paired notebooks\n\nThe most convenient way to use Jupytext is probably through [paired notebooks](https://jupytext.readthedocs.io/en/latest/paired-notebooks.html).\n\nTo pair a given `.ipynb` or text notebook to an additional notebook format, use either\n<ul>\n<details>\n  <summary>the <i>\"pair notebook with...\"</i> commands in Jupyter Lab</summary>\n\n[![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mwouts/jupytext/master/packages/labextension/jupytext_commands.png)](https://jupytext.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html#jupytext-commands-in-jupyterlab)\n</details>\n\n<details>\n  <summary>the <i>\"pair notebook with...\"</i> menu entries in Jupyter Notebook</summary>\n\n[![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mwouts/jupytext/master/jupytext/nbextension/jupytext_menu.png)](https://jupytext.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html#jupytext-menu-in-jupyter-notebook)\n</details>\n\n<details>\n  <summary><code>jupytext</code> at the command line</summary>\n\nwith e.g.\n```\njupytext --set-formats ipynb,py:percent notebook.ipynb\n```\nsee the [documentation](https://jupytext.readthedocs.io/en/latest/config.html#per-notebook-configuration).\n</details>\n\n<details>\n  <summary>or a local or global <code>jupytext.toml</code> configuration file.</summary>\n\nwith e.g. the following content:\n```\nformats = \"ipynb,py:percent\"\n```\nsee the [documentation](https://jupytext.readthedocs.io/en/latest/config.html#configuring-paired-notebooks-globally).\n</details>\n</ul>\n\nWhen you save a paired notebook in Jupyter, both the `.ipynb` file and the text version are updated on disk.\n\nWhen a paired notebook is opened or _reloaded_ in Jupyter, the input cells are loaded from the text file, and combined with the output cells from the `.ipynb` file.\n\nYou can edit the text representation of the notebook in your favorite editor, and get the changes back in Jupyter by simply _reloading_ the notebook (Ctrl+R in Jupyter Notebook, <i>\"reload notebook\"</i> in Jupyter Lab). And the changes are propagated to the `.ipynb` file when you _save_ the notebook.\n\nAlternatively, you can synchronise the two representations by running `jupytext --sync notebook.ipynb` at the command line.\n\n## Which text format?\n\nJupytext implements many text [formats](https://jupytext.readthedocs.io/en/latest/formats.html) for Jupyter Notebooks. If your notebook is mostly made of code, you will probably prefer to save it as a script:\n-  Use the [percent format](https://jupytext.readthedocs.io/en/latest/formats.html#the-percent-format), a format with explicit cell delimiters (`# %%`), supported by many IDE (Spyder, Hydrogen, VS Code, PyCharm and PTVS)\n-  Or use the [light format](https://jupytext.readthedocs.io/en/latest/formats.html#the-light-format), if you prefer to see fewer cell markers.\n\nIf your notebook contains more text than code, if you are writing a documentation or a book, you probably want to save your notebook as a Markdown document\n- Use the [Jupytext Markdown format](https://jupytext.readthedocs.io/en/latest/formats.html#jupytext-markdown) if you wish to render your notebook as a `.md` file (without its outputs) on GitHub\n- Use the [MyST Markdown format](https://jupytext.readthedocs.io/en/latest/formats.html#myst-markdown), a markdown flavor that \u201cimplements the best parts of reStructuredText\u201d, if you wish to render your notebooks using Sphinx or [Jupyter Book](https://jupyterbook.org).\n- Use the [R Markdown format](https://jupytext.readthedocs.io/en/latest/formats.html#r-markdown) if you want to open your Jupyter Notebooks in RStudio.\n\n## More resources?\n\nIf you're new to Jupytext, you may want to start with the [FAQ](https://jupytext.readthedocs.io/en/latest/faq.html) or with the [Tutorials](https://jupytext.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials.html), or with this short introduction to Jupytext: [![](https://img.shields.io/badge/YouTube-JupyterCon%202020-red.svg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDYdeVfMh48).\n\n\n",
