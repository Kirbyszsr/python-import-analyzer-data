If several of these packages are found, PyQt5 is used by\ndefault unless you set the `QT_API` environment variable.\n\n`QT_API` can take the following values:\n\n* `pyqt5` (to use PyQt5).\n* `pyqt` or `pyqt4` (to use PyQt4).\n* `pyside2` (to use PySide2)\n* `pyside` (to use PySide).\n\n\n### Installation\n\n```bash\npip install qtpy\n```\n\nor\n\n```bash\nconda install qtpy\n```\n\n\n## Contributing\n\nEveryone is welcome to contribute!\n\n\n## Sponsors\n\nBecome a sponsor to get your logo on our README on Github.\n\n[![Sponsors](https://opencollective.com/spyder/sponsors.svg)](https://opencollective.com/spyder#support)\n\n\n",
