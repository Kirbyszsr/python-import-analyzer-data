  "description": "python-jose\n===========\n\nA JOSE implementation in Python\n\n|Build Status| |Coverage Status| |Docs|\n\nDocs are available on ReadTheDocs_.\n\nThe JavaScript Object Signing and Encryption (JOSE) technologies - JSON\nWeb Signature (JWS), JSON Web Encryption (JWE), JSON Web Key (JWK), and\nJSON Web Algorithms (JWA) - collectively can be used to encrypt and/or\nsign content using a variety of algorithms. While the full set of\npermutations is extremely large, and might be daunting to some, it is\nexpected that most applications will only use a small set of algorithms\nto meet their needs.\n\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\n::\n\n    $ pip install python-jose[cryptography]\n\n\nCryptographic Backends\n----------------------\n\nAs of 3.1.0, python-jose implements four different cryptographic backends.\nThe backend must be selected as an extra when installing python-jose.\nIf you do not select a backend, the native-python backend will be installed.\n\nUnless otherwise noted, all backends support all operations.\n\nDue to complexities with setuptools, the native-python backend is always installed,\neven if you select a different backend on install.\nWe recommend that you remove unnecessary dependencies in production.\n\n#. cryptography\n\n   * This backend uses `pyca/cryptography`_ for all cryptographic operations.\n     This is the recommended backend and is selected over all other backends if any others are present.\n   * Installation: ``pip install python-jose[cryptography]``\n   * Unused dependencies:\n\n     * ``rsa``\n     * ``ecdsa``\n     * ``pyasn1``\n\n#. pycryptodome\n\n   * This backend uses `pycryptodome`_ for all cryptographic operations.\n   * Installation: ``pip install python-jose[pycryptodome]``\n   * Unused dependencies:\n\n     * ``rsa``\n\n#. native-python\n\n   * This backend uses `python-rsa`_ and `python-ecdsa`_ for all cryptographic operations.\n     This backend is always installed but any other backend will take precedence if one is installed.\n   * Installation: ``pip install python-jose``\n\n   .. note::\n\n       The native-python backend cannot process certificates.\n\n#. pycrypto\n\n   * This backend uses `pycrypto`_ for all cryptographic operations.\n   * Installation: ``pip install python-jose[pycrypto]``\n   * Unused dependencies:\n\n     * ``rsa``\n\n   .. warning::\n\n       The `pycrypto`_ project has not been maintained since 2013.\n       This backend is maintained for legacy compatibility purposes only.\n       Do not use this backend unless you cannot use any of the others.\n\nUsage\n-----\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    >>> from jose import jwt\n    >>> token = jwt.encode({'key': 'value'}, 'secret', algorithm='HS256')\n    u'eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJrZXkiOiJ2YWx1ZSJ9.FG-8UppwHaFp1LgRYQQeS6EDQF7_6-bMFegNucHjmWg'\n\n    >>> jwt.decode(token, 'secret', algorithms=['HS256'])\n    {u'key': u'value'}\n\n\nThanks\n------\n\nThis library was originally based heavily on the work of the folks over at PyJWT_.\n\n.. |Build Status| image:: https://travis-ci.org/mpdavis/python-jose.svg?branch=master\n   :target: https://travis-ci.org/mpdavis/python-jose\n.. |Coverage Status| image:: http://codecov.io/github/mpdavis/python-jose/coverage.svg?branch=master\n   :target: http://codecov.io/github/mpdavis/python-jose?branch=master\n.. |Docs| image:: https://readthedocs.org/projects/python-jose/badge/\n   :target: https://python-jose.readthedocs.org/en/latest/\n.. _ReadTheDocs: https://python-jose.readthedocs.org/en/latest/\n.. _PyJWT: https://github.com/jpadilla/pyjwt\n.. _pyca/cryptography: http://cryptography.io/\n.. _pycryptodome: https://pycryptodome.readthedocs.io/en/latest/\n.. _pycrypto: https://www.dlitz.net/software/pycrypto/\n.. _python-ecdsa: https://github.com/warner/python-ecdsa\n.. _python-rsa: https://stuvel.eu/rsa\n\n\n",
