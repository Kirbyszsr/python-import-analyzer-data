If you do use Python 3.9.0, please update to\n   the latest version of pybind11 (2.6.0 or newer), which includes a temporary\n   workaround specifically when Python 3.9.0 is detected at runtime.\n\n\n**pybind11** is a lightweight header-only library that exposes C++ types\nin Python and vice versa, mainly to create Python bindings of existing\nC++ code. Its goals and syntax are similar to the excellent\n`Boost.Python <http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_58_0/libs/python/doc/>`_\nlibrary by David Abrahams: to minimize boilerplate code in traditional\nextension modules by inferring type information using compile-time\nintrospection.\n\nThe main issue with Boost.Python\u2014and the reason for creating such a\nsimilar project\u2014is Boost. Boost is an enormously large and complex suite\nof utility libraries that works with almost every C++ compiler in\nexistence. This compatibility has its cost: arcane template tricks and\nworkarounds are necessary to support the oldest and buggiest of compiler\nspecimens. Now that C++11-compatible compilers are widely available,\nthis heavy machinery has become an excessively large and unnecessary\ndependency.\n\nThink of this library as a tiny self-contained version of Boost.Python\nwith everything stripped away that isn\u2019t relevant for binding\ngeneration. Without comments, the core header files only require ~4K\nlines of code and depend on Python (2.7 or 3.5+, or PyPy) and the C++\nstandard library. This compact implementation was possible thanks to\nsome of the new C++11 language features (specifically: tuples, lambda\nfunctions and variadic templates). Since its creation, this library has\ngrown beyond Boost.Python in many ways, leading to dramatically simpler\nbinding code in many common situations.\n\nTutorial and reference documentation is provided at\n`pybind11.readthedocs.io <https://pybind11.readthedocs.io/en/latest>`_.\nA PDF version of the manual is available\n`here <https://pybind11.readthedocs.io/_/downloads/en/latest/pdf/>`_.\nAnd the source code is always available at\n`github.com/pybind/pybind11 <https://github.com/pybind/pybind11>`_.\n\n\nCore features\n-------------\n\n\npybind11 can map the following core C++ features to Python:\n\n- Functions accepting and returning custom data structures per value,\n  reference, or pointer\n- Instance methods and static methods\n- Overloaded functions\n- Instance attributes and static attributes\n- Arbitrary exception types\n- Enumerations\n- Callbacks\n- Iterators and ranges\n- Custom operators\n- Single and multiple inheritance\n- STL data structures\n- Smart pointers with reference counting like ``std::shared_ptr``\n- Internal references with correct reference counting\n- C++ classes with virtual (and pure virtual) methods can be extended\n  in Python\n\nGoodies\n-------\n\nIn addition to the core functionality, pybind11 provides some extra\ngoodies:\n\n- Python 2.7, 3.5+, and PyPy/PyPy3 7.3 are supported with an\n  implementation-agnostic interface.\n\n- It is possible to bind C++11 lambda functions with captured\n  variables. The lambda capture data is stored inside the resulting\n  Python function object.\n\n- pybind11 uses C++11 move constructors and move assignment operators\n  whenever possible to efficiently transfer custom data types.\n\n- It\u2019s easy to expose the internal storage of custom data types through\n  Pythons\u2019 buffer protocols. This is handy e.g.\u00a0for fast conversion\n  between C++ matrix classes like Eigen and NumPy without expensive\n  copy operations.\n\n- pybind11 can automatically vectorize functions so that they are\n  transparently applied to all entries of one or more NumPy array\n  arguments.\n\n- Python\u2019s slice-based access and assignment operations can be\n  supported with just a few lines of code.\n\n- Everything is contained in just a few header files; there is no need\n  to link against any additional libraries.\n\n- Binaries are generally smaller by a factor of at least 2 compared to\n  equivalent bindings generated by Boost.Python. A recent pybind11\n  conversion of PyRosetta, an enormous Boost.Python binding project,\n  `reported <http://graylab.jhu.edu/RosettaCon2016/PyRosetta-4.pdf>`_\n  a binary size reduction of **5.4x** and compile time reduction by\n  **5.8x**.\n\n- Function signatures are precomputed at compile time (using\n  ``constexpr``), leading to smaller binaries.\n\n- With little extra effort, C++ types can be pickled and unpickled\n  similar to regular Python objects.\n\nSupported compilers\n-------------------\n\n1. Clang/LLVM 3.3 or newer (for Apple Xcode\u2019s clang, this is 5.0.0 or\n   newer)\n2. GCC 4.8 or newer\n3. Microsoft Visual Studio 2015 Update 3 or newer\n4. Intel classic C++ compiler 18 or newer (ICC 20.2 tested in CI)\n5. Cygwin/GCC (previously tested on 2.5.1)\n6. NVCC (CUDA 11.0 tested in CI)\n7. NVIDIA PGI (20.9 tested in CI)\n\nAbout\n-----\n\nThis project was created by `Wenzel\nJakob <http://rgl.epfl.ch/people/wjakob>`_.
