  "description": "The Cython language makes writing C extensions for the Python language as\neasy as Python itself.  Cython is a source code translator based on Pyrex_,\nbut supports more cutting edge functionality and optimizations.\n\nThe Cython language is a superset of the Python language (almost all Python\ncode is also valid Cython code), but Cython additionally supports optional\nstatic typing to natively call C functions, operate with C++ classes and\ndeclare fast C types on variables and class attributes.  This allows the\ncompiler to generate very efficient C code from Cython code.\n\nThis makes Cython the ideal language for writing glue code for external\nC/C++ libraries, and for fast C modules that speed up the execution of\nPython code.\n\nNote that for one-time builds, e.g. for CI/testing, on platforms that are not\ncovered by one of the wheel packages provided on PyPI *and* the pure Python wheel\nthat we provide is not used, it is substantially faster than a full source build\nto install an uncompiled (slower) version of Cython with::\n\n    pip install Cython --install-option=\"--no-cython-compile\"\n\n.. _Pyrex: http://www.cosc.canterbury.ac.nz/greg.ewing/python/Pyrex/\n\n\n",
