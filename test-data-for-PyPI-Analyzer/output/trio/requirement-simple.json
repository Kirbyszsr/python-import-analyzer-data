Like all async libraries,\nits main purpose is to help you write programs that do **multiple\nthings at the same time** with **parallelized I/O**. A web spider that\nwants to fetch lots of pages in parallel, a web server that needs to\njuggle lots of downloads and websocket connections at the same time, a\nprocess supervisor monitoring multiple subprocesses... that sort of\nthing. Compared to other libraries, Trio attempts to distinguish\nitself with an obsessive focus on **usability** and\n**correctness**. Concurrency is complicated; we try to make it *easy*\nto get things *right*.\n\nTrio was built from the ground up to take advantage of the `latest\nPython features <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0492/>`__, and\ndraws inspiration from `many sources\n<https://github.com/python-trio/trio/wiki/Reading-list>`__, in\nparticular Dave Beazley's `Curio <https://curio.readthedocs.io/>`__.\nThe resulting design is radically simpler than older competitors like\n`asyncio <https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html>`__ and\n`Twisted <https://twistedmatrix.com/>`__, yet just as capable. Trio is\nthe Python I/O library I always wanted; I find it makes building\nI/O-oriented programs easier, less error-prone, and just plain more\nfun. `Perhaps you'll find the same\n<https://github.com/python-trio/trio/wiki/Testimonials>`__.\n\nThis project is young and still somewhat experimental: the overall\ndesign is solid and the existing features are fully tested and\ndocumented, but you may encounter missing functionality or rough\nedges. We *do* encourage you do use it, but you should `read and\nsubscribe to issue #1\n<https://github.com/python-trio/trio/issues/1>`__ to get warning and a\nchance to give feedback about any compatibility-breaking changes.\n\nVital statistics:\n\n* Supported environments: Linux, macOS, or Windows running some kind of Python\n  3.6-or-better (either CPython or PyPy3 is fine). \\*BSD and illumos likely\n  work too, but are not tested.\n\n* Install: ``python3 -m pip install -U trio`` (or on Windows, maybe\n  ``py -3 -m pip install -U trio``). No compiler needed.\n\n* Tutorial and reference manual: https://trio.readthedocs.io\n\n* Bug tracker and source code: https://github.com/python-trio/trio\n\n* Real-time chat: https://gitter.im/python-trio/general\n\n* Discussion forum: https://trio.discourse.group\n\n* License: MIT or Apache 2, your choice\n\n* Contributor guide: https://trio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contributing.html\n\n* Code of conduct: Contributors are requested to follow our `code of\n  conduct\n  <https://trio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/code-of-conduct.html>`_\n  in all project spaces.\n\n\n",
