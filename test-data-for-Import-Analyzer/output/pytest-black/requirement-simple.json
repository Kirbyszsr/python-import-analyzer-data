Changes will _not_ be applied automatically.\n\n\nConfiguration\n-------------\n\nYou can override default black configuration options by placing a `pyproject.toml` file in your project directory. See example configuration [here](https://github.com/ambv/black/blob/master/pyproject.toml).\n\n\nPython package management\n-------------------------\nFor *poetry* to work correctly, include this in your pyproject.toml configuration file:\n\n```\n[tool.poetry.dev-dependencies]\n...\nblack = { version = \"*\", allow-prereleases = true }\n...\n```\n\nThis is necessary because at the time of writing all the *black* releases in PyPI have been tagged as pre-releases (beta code), which breaks *poetry*'s dependency resolution.\n\n\nTesting\n-------\n\nTo run the tests against a selection of Python interpreters:\n\n```\n$ tox\n```\n\nTo run against a specific interpreter (e.g. Python 3.6):\n\n```\n$ tox -e py36\n```\n\nThe `tox.ini` file in the root of this repository is used to configure the test environment.\n\n\nLicense\n-------\n\nDistributed under the terms of the `MIT` license, `pytest-black` is free and open source software\n\n\nIssues\n------\n\nIf you encounter any problems, please [file an issue](https://github.com/shopkeep/pytest-black/issues) along with a detailed description.",
