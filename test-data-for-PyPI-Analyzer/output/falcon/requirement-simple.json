It encourages the REST\narchitectural style, and tries to do as little as possible while\nremaining highly effective.\n\nFalcon apps work with any `WSGI <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3333/>`_\nor `ASGI <https://asgi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ server, and run like a\nchamp under CPython 3.5+ and PyPy 3.5+ (3.6+ required for ASGI).\n\nQuick Links\n-----------\n\n* `Read the docs <https://falcon.readthedocs.io/en/stable>`_\n* `Falcon add-ons and complementary packages <https://github.com/falconry/falcon/wiki>`_\n* `Falcon articles, talks and podcasts <https://github.com/falconry/falcon/wiki/Articles,-Talks-and-Podcasts>`_\n* `falconry/user for Falcon users <https://gitter.im/falconry/user>`_ @ Gitter\n* `falconry/dev for Falcon contributors <https://gitter.im/falconry/dev>`_ @ Gitter\n\nWhat People are Saying\n----------------------\n\n\"We have been using Falcon as a replacement for [framework] and we simply love the performance (three times faster) and code base size (easily half of our original [framework] code).\"\n\n\"Falcon looks great so far. I hacked together a quick test for a\ntiny server of mine and was ~40% faster with only 20 minutes of\nwork.\"\n\n\"Falcon is rock solid and it's fast.\"\n\n\"I'm loving #falconframework! Super clean and simple, I finally\nhave the speed and flexibility I need!\"\n\n\"I feel like I'm just talking HTTP at last, with nothing in the\nmiddle. Falcon seems like the requests of backend.\"\n\n\"The source code for Falcon is so good, I almost prefer it to\ndocumentation. It basically can't be wrong.\"\n\n\"What other framework has integrated support for 786 TRY IT NOW ?\"\n\nFeatures\n--------\n\nFalcon tries to do as little as possible while remaining highly effective.\n\n- ASGI, WSGI, and WebSocket support\n- Native ``asyncio`` support\n- No reliance on magic globals for routing and state management\n- Stable interfaces with an emphasis on backwards-compatibility\n- Simple API modeling through centralized RESTful routing\n- Highly-optimized, extensible code base\n- Easy access to headers and bodies through request and response\n  classes\n- DRY request processing via middleware components and hooks\n- Strict adherence to RFCs\n- Idiomatic HTTP error responses\n- Straightforward exception handling\n- Snappy testing with WSGI/ASGI helpers and mocks\n- CPython 3.5+ and PyPy 3.5+ support\n\nSupport Falcon Development\n--------------------------\n\nHas Falcon helped you make an awesome app? Show your support today with a one-time donation or by becoming a patron. Supporters get cool gear, an opportunity to promote their brand to Python developers, and\nprioritized support.\n\n* `Learn how to support Falcon development <https://falconframework.org/#sectionSupportFalconDevelopment>`_\n\nThanks!\n\nHow is Falcon Different?\n------------------------\n\n    Perfection is finally attained not when there is no longer anything\n    to add, but when there is no longer anything to take away.\n\n    *- Antoine de Saint-Exup\u00e9ry*\n\nWe designed Falcon to support the demanding needs of large-scale\nmicroservices and responsive app backends. Falcon complements more\ngeneral Python web frameworks by providing bare-metal performance,\nreliability, and flexibility wherever you need it.\n\n**Reliable.** We go to great lengths to avoid introducing breaking changes, and\nwhen we do they are fully documented and only introduced (in the spirit of\n`SemVer <http://semver.org/>`_) with a major version increment. The code is\nrigorously tested with numerous inputs and we require 100% coverage at all\ntimes. Falcon has no dependencies outside the standard library, helping\nminimize your app's attack surface while avoiding transitive bugs and breaking\nchanges.\n\n**Debuggable.** Falcon eschews magic. It's easy to tell which inputs lead to\nwhich outputs. Unhandled exceptions are never encapsulated or masked.\nPotentially surprising behaviors, such as automatic request body parsing, are\nwell-documented and disabled by default. Finally, when it comes to the\nframework itself, we take care to keep logic paths simple and understandable.\nAll this makes it easier to reason about the code and to debug edge cases in\nlarge-scale deployments.\n\n**Fast.** Same hardware, more requests. Falcon turns around requests\nsignificantly faster than other popular Python frameworks like Django and\nFlask. For an extra speed boost, Falcon compiles itself with Cython when\navailable, and also works well with `PyPy <https://pypy.org>`_. Considering a\nmove to another programming language? Benchmark with Falcon+PyPy first!\n\n**Flexible.** Falcon leaves a lot of decisions and implementation details to\nyou, the API developer. This gives you a lot of freedom to customize and tune\nyour implementation. It also helps you understand your apps at a deeper level,\nmaking them easier to tune, debug, and refactor over the long run. Falcon's\nminimalist design provides space for Python community members to independently\ninnovate on `Falcon add-ons and complementary packages\n<https://github.com/falconry/falcon/wiki>`_.\n\nWho's Using Falcon?\n-------------------\n\nFalcon is used around the world by a growing number of organizations,\nincluding:\n\n- 7ideas\n- Cronitor\n- EMC\n- Hurricane Electric\n- Leadpages\n- OpenStack\n- Rackspace\n- Shiftgig\n- tempfil.es\n- Opera Software\n\nIf you are using the Falcon framework for a community or commercial\nproject, please consider adding your information to our wiki under\n`Who's Using Falcon? <https://github.com/falconry/falcon/wiki/Who's-using-Falcon%3F>`_\n\nCommunity\n---------\n\nA number of Falcon add-ons, templates, and complementary packages are\navailable for use in your projects. We've listed several of these on the\n`Falcon wiki <https://github.com/falconry/falcon/wiki>`_ as a starting\npoint, but you may also wish to search PyPI for additional resources.\n\nThe Falconry community on Gitter is a great place to ask questions and\nshare your ideas. You can find us in `falconry/user\n<https://gitter.im/falconry/user>`_. We also have a\n`falconry/dev <https://gitter.im/falconry/dev>`_ room for discussing\nthe design and development of the framework itself.\n\nPer our\n`Code of Conduct <https://github.com/falconry/falcon/blob/master/CODEOFCONDUCT.md>`_,\nwe expect everyone who participates in community discussions to act\nprofessionally, and lead by example in encouraging constructive\ndiscussions. Each individual in the community is responsible for\ncreating a positive, constructive, and productive culture.\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nPyPy\n^^^^\n\n`PyPy <http://pypy.org/>`__ is the fastest way to run your Falcon app.\nPyPy3.5+ is supported as of PyPy v5.10.\n\n.. code:: bash\n\n    $ pip install falcon\n\nOr, to install the latest beta or release candidate, if any:\n\n.. code:: bash\n\n    $ pip install --pre falcon\n\nCPython\n^^^^^^^\n\nFalcon also fully supports\n`CPython <https://www.python.org/downloads/>`__ 3.5+.\n\nThe latest stable version of Falcon can be installed directly from PyPI:\n\n.. code:: bash\n\n    $ pip install falcon\n\nOr, to install the latest beta or release candidate, if any:\n\n.. code:: bash\n\n    $ pip install --pre falcon\n\nIn order to provide an extra speed boost, Falcon can compile itself with\nCython. Wheels containing pre-compiled binaries are available from PyPI for\nseveral common platforms. However, if a wheel for your platform of choice is not\navailable, you can choose to stick with the source distribution, or use the\ninstructions below to cythonize Falcon for your environment.\n\nThe following commands tell pip to install Cython, and then to invoke\nFalcon's ``setup.py``, which will in turn detect the presence of Cython\nand then compile (AKA cythonize) the Falcon framework with the system's\ndefault C compiler.\n\n.. code:: bash\n\n    $ pip install cython\n    $ pip install --no-build-isolation --no-binary :all: falcon\n\nNote that ``--no-build-isolation`` is necessary to override pip's default\nPEP 517 behavior that can cause Cython not to be found in the build\nenvironment.\n\nIf you want to verify that Cython is being invoked, simply\npass `-v` to pip in order to echo the compilation commands:\n\n.. code:: bash\n\n    $ pip install -v --no-build-isolation --no-binary :all: falcon\n\n**Installing on OS X**\n\nXcode Command Line Tools are required to compile Cython. Install them\nwith this command:\n\n.. code:: bash\n\n    $ xcode-select --install\n\nThe Clang compiler treats unrecognized command-line options as\nerrors, for example:\n\n.. code:: bash\n\n    clang: error: unknown argument: '-mno-fused-madd' [-Wunused-command-line-argument-hard-error-in-future]\n\nYou might also see warnings about unused functions. You can work around\nthese issues by setting additional Clang C compiler flags as follows:\n\n.. code:: bash\n\n    $ export CFLAGS=\"-Qunused-arguments -Wno-unused-function\"\n\nDependencies\n^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\nFalcon does not require the installation of any other packages, although if\nCython has been installed into the environment, it will be used to optimize\nthe framework as explained above.\n\nWSGI Server\n-----------\n\nFalcon speaks `WSGI <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3333/>`_ (or\n`ASGI <https://asgi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_; see also below). In order to\nserve a Falcon app, you will need a WSGI server. Gunicorn and uWSGI are some of\nthe more popular ones out there, but anything that can load a WSGI app will do.\n\n.. code:: bash\n\n    $ pip install [gunicorn|uwsgi]\n\nASGI Server\n-----------\n\nIn order to serve a Falcon ASGI app, you will need an ASGI server. Uvicorn\nis a popular choice:\n\n.. code:: bash\n\n    $ pip install uvicorn\n\nSource Code\n-----------\n\nFalcon `lives on GitHub <https://github.com/falconry/falcon>`_, making the\ncode easy to browse, download, fork, etc. Pull requests are always welcome! Also,\nplease remember to star the project if it makes you happy. :)\n\nOnce you have cloned the repo or downloaded a tarball from GitHub, you\ncan install Falcon like this:\n\n.. code:: bash\n\n    $ cd falcon\n    $ pip install .\n\nOr, if you want to edit the code, first fork the main repo, clone the fork\nto your desktop, and then run the following to install it using symbolic\nlinking, so that when you change your code, the changes will be automagically\navailable to your app without having to reinstall the package:\n\n.. code:: bash\n\n    $ cd falcon\n    $ pip install --no-use-pep517 -e .\n\nYou can manually test changes to the Falcon framework by switching to the\ndirectory of the cloned repo and then running pytest:\n\n.. code:: bash\n\n    $ cd falcon\n    $ pip install -r requirements/tests\n    $ pytest tests\n\nOr, to run the default set of tests:\n\n.. code:: bash\n\n    $ pip install tox && tox\n\nSee also the `tox.ini <https://github.com/falconry/falcon/blob/master/tox.ini>`_\nfile for a full list of available environments.\n\nRead the Docs\n-------------\n\nThe docstrings in the Falcon code base are quite extensive, and we\nrecommend keeping a REPL running while learning the framework so that\nyou can query the various modules and classes as you have questions.\n\nOnline docs are available at: https://falcon.readthedocs.io\n\nYou can build the same docs locally as follows:\n\n.. code:: bash\n\n    $ pip install tox && tox -e docs\n\nOnce the docs have been built, you can view them by opening the following\nindex page in your browser. On OS X it's as simple as::\n\n    $ open docs/_build/html/index.html\n\nOr on Linux:\n\n.. code:: bash\n\n    $ xdg-open docs/_build/html/index.html\n\nGetting Started\n---------------\n\nHere is a simple, contrived example showing how to create a Falcon-based\nWSGI app (the ASGI version is included further down):\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    # examples/things.py\n\n    # Let's get this party started!\n    from wsgiref.simple_server import make_server\n\n    import falcon\n\n\n    # Falcon follows the REST architectural style, meaning (among\n    # other things) that you think in terms of resources and state\n    # transitions, which map to HTTP verbs.\n    class ThingsResource:\n        def on_get(self, req, resp):\n            \"\"\"Handles GET requests\"\"\"\n            resp.status = falcon.HTTP_200  # This is the default status\n            resp.content_type = falcon.MEDIA_TEXT  # Default is JSON, so override\n            resp.text = ('\\nTwo things awe me most, the starry sky '\n                         'above me and the moral law within me.\\n'\n                         '\\n'\n                         '    ~ Immanuel Kant\\n\\n')\n\n\n    # falcon.App instances are callable WSGI apps...\n    # in larger applications the app is created in a separate file\n    app = falcon.App()\n\n    # Resources are represented by long-lived class instances\n    things = ThingsResource()\n\n    # things will handle all requests to the '/things' URL path\n    app.add_route('/things', things)\n\n    if __name__ == '__main__':\n        with make_server('', 8000, app) as httpd:\n            print('Serving on port 8000...')\n\n            # Serve until process is killed\n            httpd.serve_forever()\n\nYou can run the above example directly using the included wsgiref server:\n\n.. code:: bash\n\n    $ pip install falcon\n    $ python things.py\n\nThen, in another terminal:\n\n.. code:: bash\n\n    $ curl localhost:8000/things\n\nThe ASGI version of the example is similar:\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    # examples/things_asgi.py\n\n    import falcon\n    import falcon.asgi\n\n\n    # Falcon follows the REST architectural style, meaning (among\n    # other things) that you think in terms of resources and state\n    # transitions, which map to HTTP verbs.\n    class ThingsResource:\n        async def on_get(self, req, resp):\n            \"\"\"Handles GET requests\"\"\"\n            resp.status = falcon.HTTP_200  # This is the default status\n            resp.content_type = falcon.MEDIA_TEXT  # Default is JSON, so override\n            resp.text = ('\\nTwo things awe me most, the starry sky '\n                         'above me and the moral law within me.\\n'\n                         '\\n'\n                         '    ~ Immanuel Kant\\n\\n')\n\n\n    # falcon.asgi.App instances are callable ASGI apps...\n    # in larger applications the app is created in a separate file\n    app = falcon.asgi.App()\n\n    # Resources are represented by long-lived class instances\n    things = ThingsResource()\n\n    # things will handle all requests to the '/things' URL path\n    app.add_route('/things', things)\n\nYou can run the ASGI version with uvicorn or any other ASGI server:\n\n.. code:: bash\n\n    $ pip install falcon uvicorn\n    $ uvicorn things_asgi:app\n\nA More Complex Example (WSGI)\n-----------------------------\n\nHere is a more involved example that demonstrates reading headers and query\nparameters, handling errors, and working with request and response bodies.\nNote that this example assumes that the\n`requests <https://pypi.org/project/requests/>`_ package has been installed.\n\n(For the equivalent ASGI app, see: `A More Complex Example (ASGI)`_).\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    #
