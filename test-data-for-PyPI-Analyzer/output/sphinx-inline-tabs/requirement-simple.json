This is a fairly small package, and the development workflow is very similar to [Furo's development workflow](https://pradyunsg.me/furo/contributing/workflow/).\n\nThe [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) applies within all community spaces. If you are not familiar with our Code of Conduct policy, take a minute to read the policy before starting with your first contribution.\n\n",
