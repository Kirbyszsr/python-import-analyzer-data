It aims to provide selecting,\nmatching, and filtering using modern CSS selectors. Soup Sieve currently provides selectors from the CSS level 1\nspecifications up through the latest CSS level 4 drafts and beyond (though some are not yet implemented).\n\nSoup Sieve was written with the intent to replace Beautiful Soup's builtin select feature, and as of Beautiful Soup\nversion 4.7.0, it now is :confetti_ball:. Soup Sieve can also be imported in order to use its API directly for\nmore controlled, specialized parsing.\n\nSoup Sieve has implemented most of the CSS selectors up through the latest CSS draft specifications, though there are a\nnumber that don't make sense in a non-browser environment. Selectors that cannot provide meaningful functionality simply\ndo not match anything. Some of the supported selectors are:\n\n- `.classes`\n- `#ids`\n- `[attributes=value]`\n- `parent child`\n- `parent > child`\n- `sibling ~ sibling`\n- `sibling + sibling`\n- `:not(element.class, element2.class)`\n- `:is(element.class, element2.class)`\n- `parent:has(> child)`\n- and [many more](https://facelessuser.github.io/soupsieve/selectors/)\n\n\n## Installation\n\nYou must have Beautiful Soup already installed:\n\n```\npip install beautifulsoup4\n```\n\nIn most cases, assuming you've installed version 4.7.0, that should be all you need to do, but if you've installed via\nsome alternative method, and Soup Sieve is not automatically installed for your, you can install it directly:\n\n```\npip install soupsieve\n```\n\nIf you want to manually install it from source, navigate to the root of the project and run\n\n```\npython setup.py build\npython setup.py install\n```\n\n## Documentation\n\nDocumentation is found here: https://facelessuser.github.io/soupsieve/.\n\n## License\n\nMIT License\n\nCopyright (c) 2018 - 2021 Isaac Muse <isaacmuse@gmail.com>\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated\ndocumentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the\nrights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit\npersons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the\nSoftware.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE\nWARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
