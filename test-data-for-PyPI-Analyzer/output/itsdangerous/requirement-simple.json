Data is cryptographically signed to ensure that a\ntoken has not been tampered with.\n\nIt's possible to customize how data is serialized. Data is compressed as\nneeded. A timestamp can be added and verified automatically while\nloading a token.\n\n\nInstalling\n----------\n\nInstall and update using `pip`_:\n\n.. code-block:: text\n\n    pip install -U itsdangerous\n\n.. _pip: https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/quickstart/\n\n\nA Simple Example\n----------------\n\nHere's how you could generate a token for transmitting a user's id and\nname between web requests.\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    from itsdangerous import URLSafeSerializer\n    auth_s = URLSafeSerializer(\"secret key\", \"auth\")\n    token = auth_s.dumps({\"id\": 5, \"name\": \"itsdangerous\"})\n\n    print(token)\n    # eyJpZCI6NSwibmFtZSI6Iml0c2Rhbmdlcm91cyJ9.6YP6T0BaO67XP--9UzTrmurXSmg\n\n    data = auth_s.loads(token)\n    print(data[\"name\"])\n    # itsdangerous\n\n\nDonate\n------\n\nThe Pallets organization develops and supports itsdangerous and other\npopular packages.
