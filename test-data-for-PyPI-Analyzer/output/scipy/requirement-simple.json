  "description": "SciPy (pronounced \"Sigh Pie\") is open-source software for mathematics,\nscience, and engineering. The SciPy library\ndepends on NumPy, which provides convenient and fast N-dimensional\narray manipulation. The SciPy library is built to work with NumPy\narrays, and provides many user-friendly and efficient numerical\nroutines such as routines for numerical integration and optimization.\nTogether, they run on all popular operating systems, are quick to\ninstall, and are free of charge.  NumPy and SciPy are easy to use,\nbut powerful enough to be depended upon by some of the world's\nleading scientists and engineers. If you need to manipulate\nnumbers on a computer and display or publish the results,\ngive SciPy a try!\n\n\n\n",
