  "description": "About Whoosh\n============\n\nWhoosh is a fast, featureful full-text indexing and searching library\nimplemented in pure Python. Programmers can use it to easily add search\nfunctionality to their applications and websites. Every part of how Whoosh\nworks can be extended or replaced to meet your needs exactly.\n\nSome of Whoosh's features include:\n\n* Pythonic API.\n* Pure-Python. No compilation or binary packages needed, no mysterious crashes.\n* Fielded indexing and search.\n* Fast indexing and retrieval -- faster than any other pure-Python, scoring,\n  full-text search solution I know of.\n* Pluggable scoring algorithm (including BM25F), text analysis, storage,\n  posting format, etc.\n* Powerful query language.\n* Pure Python spell-checker (as far as I know, the only one). \n\nWhoosh might be useful in the following circumstances:\n\n* Anywhere a pure-Python solution is desirable to avoid having to build/compile\n  native libraries (or force users to build/compile them).\n* As a research platform (at least for programmers that find Python easier to\n  read and work with than Java ;)\n* When an easy-to-use Pythonic interface is more important to you than raw\n  speed. \n\nWhoosh was created and is maintained by Matt Chaput. It was originally created\nfor use in the online help system of Side Effects Software's 3D animation\nsoftware Houdini. Side Effects Software Inc. graciously agreed to open-source\nthe code.\n\nThis software is licensed under the terms of the simplified BSD (A.K.A. \"two\nclause\" or \"FreeBSD\") license. See LICENSE.txt for information.\n\nInstalling Whoosh\n=================\n\nIf you have ``setuptools`` or ``pip`` installed, you can use ``easy_install``\nor ``pip`` to download and install Whoosh automatically::\n\n    $ easy_install Whoosh\n\n    or\n\n    $ pip install Whoosh\n\nLearning more\n=============\n\n* Read the online documentation at https://whoosh.readthedocs.org/en/latest/\n\n* Join the Whoosh mailing list at http://groups.google.com/group/whoosh\n\n* File bug reports and view the Whoosh wiki at\n  http://bitbucket.org/mchaput/whoosh/\n\nGetting the source\n==================\n\nDownload source releases from PyPI at http://pypi.python.org/pypi/Whoosh/\n\nYou can check out the latest version of the source code using Mercurial::\n\n    hg clone http://bitbucket.org/mchaput/whoosh",
