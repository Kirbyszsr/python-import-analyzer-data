When using Python 3, depending on your setup, you may need to use `pip3`/`python3` explicitly. If you need to use panflute in Python 2, install panflute 1.11.x or below.\n\nCurrently supported Python versions: [![Python version](https://img.shields.io/pypi/pyversions/panflute.svg)](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/panflute/). Check `setup.py` for details, which further indicates support of pypy on top of CPython.\n\n### Supported pandoc versions\n\npandoc versioning semantics is [MAJOR.MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH](https://pvp.haskell.org) and panflute's is MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH. Below we shows matching versions of pandoc that panflute supports, in descending order. Only major version is shown as long as the minor versions doesn't matter.\n\n<!-- For pandoc API verion, check https://hackage.haskell.org/package/pandoc for pandoc-types, which is the same thing. -->\n\n| panflute version  | supported pandoc versions | supported pandoc API versions |\n| ---   | ---   |  ---  |\n| 2.0 | 2.11.0.4\u20142.11.x  | 1.22    |\n| not supported | 2.10  | 1.21  |\n| 1.12 | 2.7-2.9 | 1.17.5\u20131.20  |\n\nNote: pandoc 2.10 is short lived and 2.11 has minor API changes comparing to that, mainly for fixing its shortcomings. Please avoid using pandoc 2.10.\n\n## Contributing\n\nFeel free to submit push requests. For consistency, code should comply with [pep8](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pep8) (as long as its reasonable), and with the style guides by [@kennethreitz](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/writing/style/) and [google](http://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html).
