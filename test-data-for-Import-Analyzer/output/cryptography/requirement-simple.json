Our goal is for it to be your \"cryptographic\nstandard library\". It supports Python 3.6+ and PyPy3 7.2+.\n\n``cryptography`` includes both high level recipes and low level interfaces to\ncommon cryptographic algorithms such as symmetric ciphers, message digests, and\nkey derivation functions. For example, to encrypt something with\n``cryptography``'s high level symmetric encryption recipe:\n\n.. code-block:: pycon\n\n    >>> from cryptography.fernet import Fernet\n    >>> # Put this somewhere safe!\n    >>> key = Fernet.generate_key()\n    >>> f = Fernet(key)\n    >>> token = f.encrypt(b\"A really secret message. Not for prying eyes.\")\n    >>> token\n    '...'\n    >>> f.decrypt(token)\n    'A really secret message. Not for prying eyes.'\n\nYou can find more information in the `documentation`_.\n\nYou can install ``cryptography`` with:\n\n.. code-block:: console\n\n    $ pip install cryptography\n\nFor full details see `the installation documentation`_.\n\nDiscussion\n~~~~~~~~~~\n\nIf you run into bugs, you can file them in our `issue tracker`_.\n\nWe maintain a `cryptography-dev`_ mailing list for development discussion.\n\nYou can also join ``#cryptography-dev`` on Freenode to ask questions or get\ninvolved.\n\nSecurity\n~~~~~~~~\n\nNeed to report a security issue?
