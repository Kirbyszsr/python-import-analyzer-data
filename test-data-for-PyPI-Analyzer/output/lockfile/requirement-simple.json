  "description": "Note: This package is **deprecated**. It is highly preferred that instead of\r\nusing this code base that instead `fasteners`_ or `oslo.concurrency`_ is\r\nused instead. For any questions or comments or further help needed\r\nplease email `openstack-dev`_ and prefix your email subject\r\nwith ``[oslo][pylockfile]`` (for a faster response).\r\n\r\n.. _fasteners: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/fasteners\r\n.. _oslo.concurrency: http://docs.openstack.org/developer/oslo.concurrency/\r\n.. _openstack-dev: http://lists.openstack.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/openstack-dev\r\n\r\nThe lockfile package exports a LockFile class which provides a simple API for\r\nlocking files.  Unlike the Windows msvcrt.locking function, the fcntl.lockf\r\nand flock functions, and the deprecated posixfile module, the API is\r\nidentical across both Unix (including Linux and Mac) and Windows platforms.\r\nThe lock mechanism relies on the atomic nature of the link (on Unix) and\r\nmkdir (on Windows) system calls.  An implementation based on SQLite is also\r\nprovided, more as a demonstration of the possibilities it provides than as\r\nproduction-quality code.\r\n\r\nNote: In version 0.9 the API changed in two significant ways:\r\n\r\n * It changed from a module defining several classes to a package containing\r\n   several modules, each defining a single class.\r\n\r\n * Where classes had been named SomethingFileLock before the last two words\r\n   have been reversed, so that class is now SomethingLockFile.\r\n\r\nThe previous module-level definitions of LinkFileLock, MkdirFileLock and\r\nSQLiteFileLock will be retained until the 1.0 release.\r\n\r\nTo install:\r\n\r\n    python setup.py install\r\n\r\n* Documentation: http://docs.openstack.org/developer/pylockfile\r\n* Source: http://git.openstack.org/cgit/openstack/pylockfile\r\n* Bugs: http://bugs.launchpad.net/pylockfile",
