  "description": "Stand-alone readline module\r\n===========================\r\n\r\n**WARNING: THIS PACKAGE IS DEPRECATED! It has been renamed to GNUREADLINE\r\nto resolve a name clash with the standard library module. The new PyPI page is** `here`_.\r\n\r\nSome platforms, such as Mac OS X, do not ship with `GNU readline`_ installed.\r\nThe readline extension module in the standard library of Mac \"system\" Python\r\nuses NetBSD's `editline`_ (libedit) library instead, which is a readline\r\nreplacement with a less restrictive software license.\r\n\r\nAs the alternatives to GNU readline do not have fully equivalent functionality,\r\nit is useful to add proper readline support to these platforms. This module\r\nachieves this by bundling the standard Python readline module with the GNU\r\nreadline source code, which is compiled and statically linked to it. The end\r\nresult is a package which is simple to install and requires no extra shared\r\nlibraries.\r\n\r\nThe module can be used with both Python 2.x and 3.x, and has been tested with\r\nPython versions 2.5, 2.6, 2.7 and 3.1. The major and minor numbers of the module\r\nversion reflect the version of the underlying GNU readline library, while the\r\nthird (patch) number distinguishes different module updates based on the same\r\nreadline library.\r\n\r\nThis module is usually unnecessary on Linux and other Unix systems with default\r\nreadline support. An exception is if you have a Python distribution that does\r\nnot include GNU readline due to licensing restrictions (such as ActiveState's\r\n`ActivePython`_). If you are using Windows, which also ships without GNU \r\nreadline, you might want to consider using the `pyreadline`_ module instead, \r\nwhich is a readline replacement written in pure Python that interacts with the\r\nWindows clipboard. \r\n\r\nThe latest development version is available from the `GitHub repository`_.\r\n\r\n.. _GNU readline: http://www.gnu.org/software/readline/\r\n.. _editline: http://www.thrysoee.dk/editline/\r\n.. _ActivePython: http://community.activestate.com/faq/why-doesnt-activepython-u\r\n.. _pyreadline: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyreadline\r\n.. _GitHub repository: http://github.com/ludwigschwardt/python-readline\r\n.. _here: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/gnureadline\r\n\r\nHistory\r\n=======\r\n\r\n6.2.4.1 (2012-10-22)\r\n--------------------\r\n\r\n* #21: Fixed building on Python.org 3.3 / Mac OS 10.8\r\n* **FINAL VERSION, NO MORE UPDATES - switch to gnureadline**\r\n\r\n6.2.4 (2012-10-17)\r\n------------------\r\n\r\n* #15: Improved detection of compilers before Xcode 4.3\r\n* Uses Python 3.x readline.c from v3.3.0 tag (changeset 73997)\r\n* Updated to build against readline 6.2 (patch-level 4)\r\n\r\n6.2.2 (2012-02-24)\r\n------------------\r\n\r\n* #14: Fixed compilation with Xcode 4.3 on Mac OS 10.7\r\n* Updated to build against readline 6.2 (patch-level 2)\r\n\r\n6.2.1 (2011-08-31)\r\n------------------\r\n\r\n* #10: Fixed '_emacs_meta_keymap' missing symbol on Mac OS 10.7\r\n* #7: Fixed SDK version check to work with Mac OS 10.7 and later\r\n* Uses Python 2.x readline.c from release27-maint branch (r87358)\r\n* Uses Python 3.x readline.c from release32-maint branch (r88446)\r\n\r\n6.2.0 (2011-06-02)\r\n------------------\r\n\r\n* #5: Removed '-arch ppc' on Mac OS 10.6, as Snow Leopard supports Intel only\r\n* Updated to build against readline 6.2 (patch-level 1)\r\n\r\n6.1.0 (2010-09-20)\r\n------------------\r\n\r\n* Changed version number to reflect readline version instead of Python version\r\n* #4: Updated to build against readline 6.1 (patch-level 2)\r\n* #2: Python 3 support\r\n* Uses Python 2.x readline.c from release27-maint branch (r83672)\r\n* Uses Python 3.x readline.c from r32a2 tag (r84541)\r\n* Source code moved to GitHub\r\n* Additional maintainer: Sridhar Ratnakumar\r\n\r\n2.6.4 (2009-11-26)\r\n------------------\r\n\r\n* Added -fPIC to compiler flags to fix linking error on 64-bit Ubuntu\r\n* Enabled all readline functionality specified in pyconfig.h macros\r\n* Uses readline.c from Python svn trunk (r75725), which followed 2.6.4 release\r\n* Patched readline.c to replace Py_XDECREF calls with the safer Py_CLEAR\r\n* Fixed compilation error on Mac OS 10.4 with XCode older than version 2.4\r\n\r\n2.6.1 (2009-11-18)\r\n------------------\r\n\r\n* Updated package to work with Mac OS 10.6 (Snow Leopard), which ships with \r\n  Python 2.6.1\r\n* Uses readline.c from Python 2.6.1 release\r\n* Backported \"spurious trailing space\" bugfix from Python svn trunk (see e.g. \r\n  https://bugs.launchpad.net/python/+bug/470824 for details on bug)\r\n* Updated to build against readline 6.0 (patch-level 4)\r\n* Now builds successfully on Linux (removed Mac-specific flags in this case),\r\n  and still supports Mac OS 10.4 and 10.5\r\n\r\n2.5.1 (2008-05-28)\r\n------------------\r\n\r\n* Updated package to work with Mac OS 10.5 (Leopard), which ships with Python \r\n  2.5.1\r\n* Uses readline.c from Python 2.5.1 release\r\n* Updated to build against readline 5.2 (patch-level 12)\r\n* New maintainer: Ludwig Schwardt\r\n\r\n2.4.2 (2005-12-26)\r\n------------------\r\n\r\n* Original package by Bob Ippolito, supporting Python 2.3 / 2.4 on Mac OS 10.3 \r\n  (Panther) and 10.4 (Tiger)\r\n* Builds against readline 5.1",
