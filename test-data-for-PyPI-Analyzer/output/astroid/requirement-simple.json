Tidelift gives software development teams a single source for\n       purchasing and maintaining their software, with professional grade assurances\n       from the experts who know it best, while seamlessly integrating with existing\n       tools.\n\n.. _Tidelift Subscription: https://tidelift.com/subscription/pkg/pypi-astroid?utm_source=pypi-astroid&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=readme\n\n\n\nWhat's this?\n------------\n\nThe aim of this module is to provide a common base representation of\npython source code. It is currently the library powering pylint's capabilities.\n\nIt provides a compatible representation which comes from the `_ast`\nmodule.  It rebuilds the tree generated by the builtin _ast module by\nrecursively walking down the AST and building an extended ast. The new\nnode classes have additional methods and attributes for different\nusages. They include some support for static inference and local name\nscopes. Furthermore, astroid can also build partial trees by inspecting living\nobjects.\n\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nExtract the tarball, jump into the created directory and run::\n\n\tpip install .\n\n\nIf you want to do an editable installation, you can run::\n\n    pip install -e .\n\n\nIf you have any questions, please mail the code-quality@python.org\nmailing list for support. See\nhttp://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/code-quality for subscription\ninformation and archives.\n\nDocumentation\n-------------\nhttp://astroid.readthedocs.io/en/latest/\n\n\nPython Versions\n---------------\n\nastroid 2.0 is currently available for Python 3 only. If you want Python 2\nsupport, use an older version of astroid (though note that these versions\nare no longer supported).\n\nTest\n----\n\nTests are in the 'test' subdirectory. To launch the whole tests suite, you can use\neither `tox` or `pytest`::\n\n  tox\n  pytest astroid\n\n\n",
