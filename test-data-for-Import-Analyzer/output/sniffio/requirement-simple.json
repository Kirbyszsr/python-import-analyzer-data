You've decided to be ambitious, and support\nmultiple async I/O packages, like `Trio\n<https://trio.readthedocs.io>`__, and `asyncio\n<https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html>`__, and ... You've\nwritten a bunch of clever code to handle all the differences. But...\nhow do you know *which* piece of clever code to run?\n\nThis is a tiny package whose only purpose is to let you detect which\nasync library your code is running under.\n\n* Documentation: https://sniffio.readthedocs.io\n\n* Bug tracker and source code: https://github.com/python-trio/sniffio\n\n* License: MIT or Apache License 2.0, your choice\n\n* Contributor guide: https://trio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contributing.html\n\n* Code of conduct: Contributors are requested to follow our `code of\n  conduct\n  <https://trio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/code-of-conduct.html>`_\n  in all project spaces.\n\nThis library is maintained by the Trio project, as a service to the\nasync Python community as a whole.\n\n\nQuickstart\n----------\n\n.. code-block:: python3\n\n   from sniffio import current_async_library\n   import trio\n   import asyncio\n\n   async def print_library():\n       library = current_async_library()\n       print(\"This is:\", library)\n\n   # Prints \"This is trio\"\n   trio.run(print_library)\n\n   # Prints \"This is asyncio\"\n   asyncio.run(print_library())\n\nFor more details, including how to add support to new async libraries,\n`please peruse our fine manual <https://sniffio.readthedocs.io>`__.\n\n\n",
