It is maintained by the\n   `Zope Toolkit project <http://docs.zope.org/zopetoolkit/>`_.\n\nThis package provides an implementation of browser resources. It also\nprovides directives for defining those resources using ZCML.\n\nResources are static files and directories that are served to the browser\ndirectly from the filesystem. The most common example are images, CSS style\nsheets, or JavaScript files.\n\nResources are be registered under a symbolic name and can later be referred to\nby that name, so their usage is independent from their physical\nlocation. Resources can also easily be internationalized.\n\nDocumentation is hosted at https://zopebrowserresource.readthedocs.io\n\n\n=========\n Changes\n=========\n\n4.4 (2019-12-10)\n================\n\n- Make the registration of the ``FileETag`` adapter conditional on the environment\n  as Zope 4 registers this adapter explicitly in ``Products.Five.browser``.\n  See `#12 <https://github.com/zopefoundation/zope.browserresource/pull/12>`_.\n\n- Add support for Python 3.8.\n\n- Drop support for Python 3.4.\n\n\n4.3 (2018-10-05)\n================\n\n- Add support for Python 3.7.\n\n- Host documentation at https://zopebrowserresource.readthedocs.io\n\n- Add ``.git`` to the list of directory names that are ignored by default.\n\n- Fix test compatibility with zope.i18n 4.3.\n  See `#8 <https://github.com/zopefoundation/zope.browserresource/issues/8>`_\n\n\n4.2.1 (2017-09-01)\n==================\n\n- Fix dependencies of the ``zcml`` extra.\n\n\n4.2.0 (2017-08-04)\n==================\n\n- Add support for Python 3.5 and 3.6.\n\n- Drop support for Python 2.6 and 3.3.\n\n\n4.1.0 (2014-12-26)\n==================\n\n- Add support for PyPy.  PyPy3 support awaits release of fix for:\n  https://bitbucket.org/pypy/pypy/issue/1946\n\n- Add support for Python 3.4.\n\n- Add support for testing on Travis.\n\n\n4.0.2 (2014-11-04)\n==================\n\n- Return no ETag if no adapter is registered, disabling the\n  requirement for applications that was introduced in 3.11.0 (GitHub #1)\n\n\n4.0.1 (2013-04-03)\n==================\n\n- Fix some Python 3 string vs bytes issues.\n\n\n4.0.0 (2013-02-20)\n==================\n\n- Replace deprecated `zope.component.adapts` usage with equivalent\n  `zope.component.adapter` decorator.\n\n- Replace deprecated `zope.interface.classProvides` usage with equivalent\n  `zope.interface.provider` decorator.\n\n- Replace deprecated `zope.interface.implementsOnly` usage with equivalent\n  `zope.interface.implementer_only` decorator.\n\n- Replace deprecated `zope.interface.implements` usage with equivalent\n  `zope.interface.implementer` decorator.\n\n- Drop support for Python 2.4 and 2.5.\n\n- Add support for Python 3.3.\n\n\n3.12.0 (2010-12-14)\n===================\n\n- Add ``zcml`` extra dependencies and fixed dependencies of\n  ``configure.zcml`` on other packages' ``meta.zcml``.\n\n- Add a test for including our own ``configure.zcml``.\n\n3.11.0 (2010-08-13)\n===================\n\n- Support the HTTP ETag header for file resources.  ETag generation can be\n  customized or disabled by providing an IETag multi-adapter on\n  (IFileResource, your-application-skin).\n\n3.10.3 (2010-04-30)\n===================\n\n- Prefer the standard libraries doctest module to the one from zope.testing.\n\n3.10.2 (2009-11-25)\n===================\n\n- The previous release had a broken egg, sorry.\n\n3.10.1 (2009-11-24)\n===================\n\n- Import hooks functionality from zope.component after it was moved there from\n  zope.site. This lifts the dependency on zope.site and thereby, ZODB.\n\n- Import ISite and IPossibleSite from zope.component after they were moved\n  there from zope.location.\n\n3.10.0 (2009-09-25)\n===================\n\n- Add an ability to forbid publishing of some files in the resource directory,\n  this is done by fnmatch'ing the wildcards in the ``forbidden_names``class\n  attribute of ``DirectoryResource``. By default, the ``.svn`` is in that\n  attribute, so directories won't publish subversion system directory that can\n  contain private information.\n\n3.9.0 (2009-08-27)\n==================\n\nInitial release. This package was splitted off zope.app.publisher as a part\nof refactoring process.\n\nAdditional changes that are made during refactoring:\n\n * Resource class for file resources are now selected the pluggable way.\n   The resource directory publisher and browser:resource ZCML directive\n   now creating file resources using factory utility lookup based on the\n   file extension, so it's now possible to add new resource types without\n   introducing new ZCML directives and they will work inside resource\n   directories as well.\n\n   NOTE: the \"resource_factories\" attribute from the DirectoryResource\n   was removed, so if you were using this attribute for changing resource\n   classes for some file extensions, you need to migrate your code to new\n   utility-based mechanism.\n\n   See zope.browserresource.interfaces.IResourceFactoryFactory interface.\n\n * The Image resource class was removed, as they are actually simple files.\n   To migrate, simply rename the \"image\" argument in browser:resource and\n   browser:i18n-resource directives to \"file\", if you don't do this, resouces\n   will work, but you'll get deprecation warnings.\n\n   If you need custom behaviour for images, you can register a resource\n   factory utility for needed file extensions.\n\n * The PageTemplateResource was moved into a separate package, \"zope.ptresource\",\n   which is a plugin for this package now. Because of that, the \"template\"\n   argument of browser:resource directive was deprecated and you should rename\n   it to \"file\" to migrate. The PageTemplateResource will be created for\n   \"pt\", \"zpt\" and \"html\" files automatically, if zope.ptresource package is\n   included in your configuration.\n\n * Fix stripping the \"I\" from an interface name for icon title, if no\n   title is specified.\n\n * When publishing a resource via Resources view, set resource parent\n   to an ISite object, not to current site manager.\n\n * Clean up code and improve test coverage.\n\n\n",
