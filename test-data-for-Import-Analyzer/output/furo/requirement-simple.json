To use the theme in your Sphinx project:\n\n1. Install Furo in documentation's build environment.\n\n   ```text\n   pip install furo\n   ```\n\n2. Update the `html_theme` in `conf.py`.\n\n   ```py\n   html_theme = \"furo\"\n   ```\n\n3. Your Sphinx documentation's HTML pages will now be generated with this theme! \ud83c\udf89\n\n[pypi]: https://pypi.org/project/furo/\n\n<!-- end quickstart -->\n\nFor more information, visit [Furo's documentation][quickstart-docs].\n\n[quickstart-docs]: https://pradyunsg.me/furo/quickstart\n\n## Contributing\n\nFuro is a volunteer maintained open source project, and we welcome contributions of all forms. Please take a look at our [Contributing Guide](https://pradyunsg.me/furo/contributing/) for more information.\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\nFuro is inspired by (and borrows elements from) some excellent technical documentation themes:\n\n- [mkdocs-material] for MkDocs\n- [Just the Docs] for Jekyll\n- [GitBook]\n\nWe use [BrowserStack] to test on real devices and browsers. Shoutout to them for supporting OSS projects!\n\n[mkdocs-material]: https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/\n[just the docs]: https://pmarsceill.github.io/just-the-docs/\n[gitbook]: https://www.gitbook.com/\n[browserstack]: https://browserstack.com/\n\n## What's with the name?\n\nI plucked this from the scientific name for [Domesticated Ferrets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferret): Mustela putorius **furo**.\n\nA ferret is actually a really good spirit animal for this project: cute, small, steals little things from various places, and hisses at you when you try to make it do things it doesn't like.\n\n> I plan on commissioning a logo for this project (or making one myself) consisting of a cute ferret. Please reach out if you're interested!\n\n## Used By\n\n<!-- start used-by -->\n\n> I'm being told that mentioning who uses `$thing` is a good way to promote `$thing`.\n\n- [urllib3] -- THE first adopter of Furo.\n- [attrs] (also one of the early adopters!)\n- [psycopg3]\n- [pip]\n- [packaging]\n\nI'm also a maintainer on the last two, so... that covers responsible disclosure. :)\n\n[urllib3]: https://urllib3.readthedocs.io/\n[attrs]: https://www.attrs.org/\n[psycopg3]: https://www.psycopg.org/psycopg3/docs/\n[pip]: https://pip.pypa.io/\n[packaging]: https://packaging.pypa.io/\n\n<!-- end used-by -->\n\n## License\n\nThis project is licensed under the MIT License.\n\n",
