  "description": "Jupyter Widgets JupyterLab Extension\n====================================\n\nA JupyterLab 3.0 extension for Jupyter/IPython widgets.\n\n## Installation\n\nTo enable ipywidgets support in JupyterLab 3.x:\n\n```bash\npip install jupyterlab_widgets\n```\n\n### Version compatibility\n\nPrior to JupyterLab 3.0, use the appropriate command from the following list\nto install a compatible JupyterLab extension.\n\n* For JupyterLab 0.30, use `jupyter labextension install @jupyter-widgets/jupyterlab-manager@0.31`\n* For JupyterLab 0.31rc1, use `jupyter labextension install @jupyter-widgets/jupyterlab-manager@0.32`\n* For JupyterLab 0.31rc2, use `jupyter labextension install @jupyter-widgets/jupyterlab-manager@0.33`\n* For JupyterLab 0.31.x, use `jupyter labextension install @jupyter-widgets/jupyterlab-manager@0.34`\n* For JupyterLab 0.32.x, use `jupyter labextension install @jupyter-widgets/jupyterlab-manager@0.35`\n* For JupyterLab 0.33.x, use `jupyter labextension install @jupyter-widgets/jupyterlab-manager@0.36`\n* For JupyterLab 0.34.x, use `jupyter labextension install @jupyter-widgets/jupyterlab-manager@0.37`\n* For JupyterLab 0.35.x, use `jupyter labextension install @jupyter-widgets/jupyterlab-manager@0.38`\n* For JupyterLab 1.0.x and 1.1.x, use `jupyter labextension install @jupyter-widgets/jupyterlab-manager@1.0`\n* For JupyterLab 1.2.x, use `jupyter labextension install @jupyter-widgets/jupyterlab-manager@1.1`\n* For JupyterLab 2.x, use `jupyter labextension install @jupyter-widgets/jupyterlab-manager@2`\n\n\n\n## Contributing\n\n### Development install\n\nNote: You will need Node.js to build the extension package.\n\nThe `jlpm` command is JupyterLab's pinned version of\n[yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) that is installed with JupyterLab. You may use\n`yarn` or `npm` in lieu of `jlpm` below.\n\n```bash\n# Clone the repo to your local environment\n# Change directory to the jupyterlab_widgets directory\n# Install package in development mode\npip install -e .\n# Link your development version of the extension with JupyterLab\njupyter labextension develop . --overwrite\n# Rebuild extension Typescript source after making changes\njlpm run build\n```\n\nYou can watch the source directory and run JupyterLab at the same time in different terminals to watch for changes in the extension's source and automatically rebuild the extension.\n\n```bash\n# Watch the source directory in one terminal, automatically rebuilding when needed\njlpm run watch\n# Run JupyterLab in another terminal\njupyter lab\n```\n\nWith the watch command running, every saved change will immediately be built locally and available in your running JupyterLab. Refresh JupyterLab to load the change in your browser (you may need to wait several seconds for the extension to be rebuilt).\n\n### Uninstall\n\n```bash\npip uninstall jupyterlab_widgets\n```\n\n\n",
