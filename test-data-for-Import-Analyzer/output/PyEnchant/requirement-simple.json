For more information, visit the project website:\n\n    http://pyenchant.github.io/pyenchant/\n\nWhat is Enchant?\n----------------\n\nEnchant is used to check the spelling of words and suggest corrections\nfor words that are miss-spelled.  It can use many popular spellchecking\npackages to perform this task, including ispell, aspell and MySpell.  It\nis quite flexible at handling multiple dictionaries and multiple\nlanguages.\n\nMore information is available on the Enchant website:\n\n    https://abiword.github.io/enchant/\n\n\nHow do I use it?\n----------------\n\nFor Windows users, install the pre-built binary packages using\npip::\n\n    pip install pyenchant\n\n\nThese packages bundle a pre-built copy of the underlying enchant library.\nUsers on other platforms will need to install \"enchant\" using their system\npackage manager (brew on macOS).\n\nOnce the software is installed, python's on-line help facilities can\nget you started.  Launch python and issue the following commands:\n\n    >>> import enchant\n    >>> help(enchant)\n\n\n\nWho is responsible for all this?\n--------------------------------\n\nThe credit for Enchant itself goes to Dom Lachowicz.  Find out more details\non the Enchant website listed above.  Full marks to Dom for producing such\na high-quality library.\n\nThe glue to pull Enchant into Python via ctypes was written by Ryan Kelly.\nHe needed a decent spellchecker for another project he was working on, and\nall the solutions turned up by Google were either extremely non-portable\n(e.g. opening a pipe to ispell) or had completely disappeared from the web\n(what happened to SnakeSpell?)  It was also a great excuse to teach himself\nabout SWIG, ctypes, and even a little bit of the Python/C API.\n\nFinally, after Ryan stepped down from the project, Dimitri Merejkowsky\nbecame the new maintainer.\n\n\n\n",
