Currently, Jupyter Server only has minor and patch versions. Different minor versions likely include API-changes while patch versions do not change API.\n\nWhen a new minor version is released on PyPI, a branch for that version will be created in this repository, and the version of the master branch will be bumped to the next minor version number. That way, the master branch always reflects the latest un-released version.\n\nTo see the changes between releases, checkout the [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter_server/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).\n\n\n## Usage - Running Jupyter Server\n\n### Running in a local installation\n\nLaunch with:\n\n    jupyter server\n\n### Testing\n\nTo test an installed `jupyter_server`, run the following:\n\n    pip install jupyter_server[test]\n    pytest jupyter_server\n\n## Contributing\n\nIf you are interested in contributing to the project, see [`CONTRIBUTING.rst`](CONTRIBUTING.rst).\n\n## Team Meetings and Roadmap\n\n* When: Thursdays [8:00am, Pacific time](https://www.thetimezoneconverter.com/?t=8%3A00%20am&tz=San%20Francisco&)\n* Where: [Jovyan Zoom](https://zoom.us/my/jovyan?pwd=c0JZTHlNdS9Sek9vdzR3aTJ4SzFTQT09)\n* What: [Meeting notes](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter_server/issues/126)\n\nSee our tentative [roadmap here](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter_server/issues/127).\n\n\n",
