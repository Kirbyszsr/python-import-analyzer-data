  "description": "Cerberus |latest-version|\n=========================\n|build-status| |python-support| |black|\n\nCerberus is a lightweight and extensible data validation library for Python.\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    >>> v = Validator({'name': {'type': 'string'}})\n    >>> v.validate({'name': 'john doe'})\n    True\n\n\nFeatures\n--------\n\nCerberus provides type checking and other base functionality out of the box and\nis designed to be non-blocking and easily and widely extensible, allowing for\ncustom validation. It has no dependencies, but has the potential to become\nyours.\n\n\nVersioning & Interpreter support\n--------------------------------\n\nThe Cerberus `1.x` versions can be used with Python 2 while version `2.0` and\nlater rely on Python 3 features.\n\nStarting with Cerberus 1.2, it is maintained according to\n`semantic versioning`_. So, a major release sheds off the old and defines a\nspace for the new, minor releases ship further new features and improvements\n(you now the drill, new bugs are inevitable too), and micro releases polish a\ndefinite amount of features to glory.\n\nWe intend to test Cerberus against all CPython interpreters at least until half\na year after their `end of life`_ and against the most recent PyPy interpreter\nas a requirement for a release. If you still need to use it with a potential\nsecurity hole in your setup, it should most probably work with the latest\nminor version branch from the time when the interpreter was still tested.\nSubsequent minor versions have good chances as well. In any case, you are\nadvised to run the contributed test suite on your target system.\n\n\nFunding\n-------\n\nCerberus is an open source, collaboratively funded project. If you run a\nbusiness and are using Cerberus in a revenue-generating product, it would\nmake business sense to sponsor its development: it ensures the project that\nyour product relies on stays healthy and actively maintained. Individual users\nare also welcome to make a recurring pledge or a one time donation if Cerberus\nhas helped you in your work or personal projects.\n\nEvery single sign-up makes a significant impact towards making Eve possible. To\nlearn more, check out our `funding page`_.\n\n\nDocumentation\n-------------\n\nComplete documentation is available at http://docs.python-cerberus.org\n\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nCerberus is on PyPI_, so all you need to do is:\n\n.. code-block:: console\n\n    $ pip install cerberus\n\n\nTesting\n-------\n\nJust run:\n\n.. code-block:: console\n\n    $ python setup.py test\n\nOr you can use tox to run the tests under all supported Python versions. Make\nsure the required python versions are installed and run:\n\n.. code-block:: console\n\n    $ pip install tox  # first time only\n    $ tox\n\n\nContributing\n------------\n\nPlease see the `Contribution Guidelines`_.\n\n\nCopyright\n---------\n\nCerberus is an open source project by `Nicola Iarocci`_.
