  "description": "Pure Python RSA implementation\n==============================\n\n[![PyPI](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/rsa.svg)](https://pypi.org/project/rsa/)\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/sybrenstuvel/python-rsa.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/sybrenstuvel/python-rsa)\n[![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/sybrenstuvel/python-rsa/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/github/sybrenstuvel/python-rsa?branch=master)\n[![Code Climate](https://api.codeclimate.com/v1/badges/a99a88d28ad37a79dbf6/maintainability)](https://codeclimate.com/github/codeclimate/codeclimate/maintainability)\n\n[Python-RSA](https://stuvel.eu/rsa) is a pure-Python RSA implementation. It supports\nencryption and decryption, signing and verifying signatures, and key\ngeneration according to PKCS#1 version 1.5. It can be used as a Python\nlibrary as well as on the commandline. The code was mostly written by\nSybren A.  St\u00fcvel.\n\nDocumentation can be found at the [Python-RSA homepage](https://stuvel.eu/rsa). For all changes, check [the changelog](https://github.com/sybrenstuvel/python-rsa/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).\n\nDownload and install using:\n\n    pip install rsa\n\nor download it from the [Python Package Index](https://pypi.org/project/rsa/).\n\nThe source code is maintained at [GitHub](https://github.com/sybrenstuvel/python-rsa/) and is\nlicensed under the [Apache License, version 2.0](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)\n\nSecurity\n--------\n\nBecause of how Python internally stores numbers, it is very hard (if not impossible) to make a pure-Python program secure against timing attacks. This library is no exception, so use it with care. See https://securitypitfalls.wordpress.com/2018/08/03/constant-time-compare-in-python/ for more info.\n\n\nMajor changes in 4.1\n--------------------\n\nVersion 4.0 was the last version to support Python 2 and 3.4. Version 4.1 is compatible with Python 3.5+ only.\n\n\nMajor changes in 4.0\n--------------------\n\nVersion 3.4 was the last version in the 3.x range. Version 4.0 drops the following modules,\nas they are insecure:\n\n- `rsa._version133`\n- `rsa._version200`\n- `rsa.bigfile`\n- `rsa.varblock`\n\nThose modules were marked as deprecated in version 3.4.\n\nFurthermore, in 4.0 the I/O functions is streamlined to always work with bytes on all\nsupported versions of Python.\n\nVersion 4.0 drops support for Python 2.6 and 3.3.\n\n\n",
