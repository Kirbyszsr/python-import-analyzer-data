Contains warnings that don't belong in pyflakes and\npycodestyle::\n\n    bug\u00b7bear  (b\u016dg\u2032b\u00e2r\u2032)\n    n.\n    1. A cause of fear, anxiety, or irritation: *Overcrowding is often\n       a bugbear for train commuters.*\n    2. A difficult or persistent problem: *\"One of the major bugbears of\n       traditional AI is the difficulty of programming computers to\n       recognize that different but similar objects are instances of the\n       same type of thing\" (Jack Copeland).*\n    3. A fearsome imaginary creature, especially one evoked to frighten\n       children.\n\nIt is felt that these lints don't belong in the main Python tools as they\nare very opinionated and do not have a PEP or standard behind them. Due to\n``flake8`` being designed to be extensible, the original creators of these lints\nbelieved that a plugin was the best route. This has resulted in better development\nvelocity for contributors and adaptive deployment for ``flake8`` users.\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nInstall from ``pip`` with:\n\n.. code-block:: sh\n\n     pip install flake8-bugbear\n\nIt will then automatically be run as part of ``flake8``; you can check it has\nbeen picked up with:\n\n.. code-block:: sh\n\n    $ flake8 --version\n    3.5.0 (assertive: 1.0.1, flake8-bugbear: 18.2.0, flake8-comprehensions: 1.4.1, mccabe: 0.6.1, pycodestyle: 2.3.1, pyflakes: 1.6.0) CPython 3.7.0 on Darwin\n\nDevelopment\n-----------\n\nIf you'd like to do a PR we have development instructions `here <https://github.com/PyCQA/flake8-bugbear/blob/master/DEVELOPMENT.md>`_.\n\nList of warnings\n----------------\n\n**B001**: Do not use bare ``except:``, it also catches unexpected events\nlike memory errors, interrupts, system exit, and so on.  Prefer ``except\nException:``.  If you're sure what you're doing, be explicit and write\n``except BaseException:``.  Disable E722 to avoid duplicate warnings.\n\n**B002**: Python does not support the unary prefix increment. Writing\n``++n`` is equivalent to ``+(+(n))``, which equals ``n``. You meant ``n\n+= 1``.\n\n**B003**: Assigning to ``os.environ`` doesn't clear the\nenvironment.  Subprocesses are going to see outdated\nvariables, in disagreement with the current process.  Use\n``os.environ.clear()`` or the ``env=``  argument to Popen.\n\n**B004**: Using ``hasattr(x, '__call__')`` to test if ``x`` is callable\nis unreliable.  If ``x`` implements custom ``__getattr__`` or its\n``__call__`` is itself not callable, you might get misleading\nresults.  Use ``callable(x)`` for consistent results.\n\n**B005**: Using ``.strip()`` with multi-character strings is misleading\nthe reader. It looks like stripping a substring. Move your\ncharacter set to a constant if this is deliberate. Use\n``.replace()`` or regular expressions to remove string fragments.\n\n**B006**: Do not use mutable data structures for argument defaults.  They\nare created during function definition time. All calls to the function\nreuse this one instance of that data structure, persisting changes\nbetween them.\n\n**B007**: Loop control variable not used within the loop body.  If this is\nintended, start the name with an underscore.\n\n**B008**: Do not perform function calls in argument defaults.  The call is\nperformed only once at function definition time. All calls to your\nfunction will reuse the result of that definition-time function call.  If\nthis is intended, assign the function call to a module-level variable and\nuse that variable as a default value.\n\n**B009**: Do not call ``getattr(x, 'attr')``, instead use normal\nproperty access: ``x.attr``. Missing a default to ``getattr`` will cause\nan ``AttributeError`` to be raised for non-existent properties. There is\nno additional safety in using ``getattr`` if you know the attribute name\nahead of time.\n\n**B010**: Do not call ``setattr(x, 'attr', val)``, instead use normal\nproperty access: ``x.attr = val``. There is no additional safety in\nusing ``setattr`` if you know the attribute name ahead of time.\n\n**B011**: Do not call ``assert False`` since ``python -O`` removes these calls.\nInstead callers should ``raise AssertionError()``.\n\n**B012**: Use of ``break``, ``continue`` or ``return`` inside ``finally`` blocks will\nsilence exceptions or override return values from the ``try`` or ``except`` blocks.\nTo silence an exception, do it explicitly in the ``except`` block. To properly use\na ``break``, ``continue`` or ``return`` refactor your code so these statements are not\nin the ``finally`` block.\n\n**B013**: A length-one tuple literal is redundant.  Write ``except SomeError:``\ninstead of ``except (SomeError,):``.\n\n**B014**: Redundant exception types in ``except (Exception, TypeError):``.\nWrite ``except Exception:``, which catches exactly the same exceptions.\n\n**B015**: Pointless comparison. This comparison does nothing but\nwaste CPU instructions. Either prepend ``assert`` or remove it.\n\n**B016**: Cannot raise a literal. Did you intend to return it or raise\nan Exception?\n\n**B017**: ``self.assertRaises(Exception):`` should be considered evil. It can lead \nto your test passing even if the code being tested is never executed due to a typo. \nEither assert for a more specific exception (builtin or custom), use \n``assertRaisesRegex``, or use the context manager form of assertRaises\n(``with self.assertRaises(Exception) as ex:``) with an assertion against the\ndata available in ``ex``.\n\n\nPython 3 compatibility warnings\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nThese have higher risk of false positives but discover regressions that\nare dangerous to slip through when test coverage is not great. Let me\nknow if a popular library is triggering any of the following warnings\nfor valid code.\n\n**B301**: Python 3 does not include ``.iter*`` methods on dictionaries.\nThe default behavior is to return iterables. Simply remove the ``iter``\nprefix from the method.  For Python 2 compatibility, also prefer the\nPython 3 equivalent if you expect that the size of the dict to be small\nand bounded. The performance regression on Python 2 will be negligible\nand the code is going to be the clearest.  Alternatively, use\n``six.iter*`` or ``future.utils.iter*``.\n\n**B302**: Python 3 does not include ``.view*`` methods on dictionaries.\nThe default behavior is to return viewables. Simply remove the ``view``\nprefix from the method.  For Python 2 compatibility, also prefer the\nPython 3 equivalent if you expect that the size of the dict to be small\nand bounded. The performance regression on Python 2 will be negligible\nand the code is going to be the clearest.  Alternatively, use\n``six.view*`` or ``future.utils.view*``.\n\n**B303**: The ``__metaclass__`` attribute on a class definition does\nnothing on Python 3. Use ``class MyClass(BaseClass, metaclass=...)``.\nFor Python 2 compatibility, use ``six.add_metaclass``.\n\n**B304**: ``sys.maxint`` is not a thing on Python 3. Use\n``sys.maxsize``.\n\n**B305**: ``.next()`` is not a thing on Python 3. Use the ``next()``\nbuiltin. For Python 2 compatibility, use ``six.next()``.\n\n**B306**: ``BaseException.message`` has been deprecated as of Python 2.6\nand is removed in Python 3. Use ``str(e)`` to access the user-readable\nmessage. Use ``e.args`` to access arguments passed to the exception.\n\n\nOpinionated warnings\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nThe following warnings are disabled by default because they are\ncontroversial.  They may or may not apply to you, enable them explicitly\nin your configuration if you find them useful.  Read below on how to\nenable.\n\n**B901**: Using ``return x`` in a generator function used to be\nsyntactically invalid in Python 2. In Python 3 ``return x`` can be used\nin a generator as a return value in conjunction with ``yield from``.\nUsers coming from Python 2 may expect the old behavior which might lead\nto bugs.  Use native ``async def`` coroutines or mark intentional\n``return x`` usage with ``# noqa`` on the same line.\n\n**B902**: Invalid first argument used for method. Use ``self`` for\ninstance methods, and ``cls`` for class methods (which includes ``__new__``\nand ``__init_subclass__``) or instance methods of metaclasses (detected as\nclasses directly inheriting from ``type``).\n\n**B903**: Use ``collections.namedtuple`` (or ``typing.NamedTuple``) for\ndata classes that only set attributes in an ``__init__`` method, and do\nnothing else. If the attributes should be mutable, define the attributes\nin ``__slots__`` to save per-instance memory and to prevent accidentally\ncreating additional attributes on instances.\n\n**B950**: Line too long. This is a pragmatic equivalent of\n``pycodestyle``'s E501: it considers \"max-line-length\" but only triggers\nwhen the value has been exceeded by **more than 10%**. You will no\nlonger be forced to reformat code due to the closing parenthesis being\none character too far to satisfy the linter. At the same time, if you do\nsignificantly violate the line length, you will receive a message that\nstates what the actual limit is. This is inspired by Raymond Hettinger's\n`\"Beyond PEP 8\" talk <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf-BqAjZb8M>`_ and\nhighway patrol not stopping you if you drive < 5mph too fast. Disable\nE501 to avoid duplicate warnings.\n\n\nHow to enable opinionated warnings\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nTo enable these checks, specify a ``--select`` command-line option or\n``select=`` option in your config file.  As of Flake8 3.0, this option\nis a whitelist (checks not listed are being implicitly disabled), so you\nhave to explicitly specify all checks you want enabled. For example::\n\n\t[flake8]\n\tmax-line-length = 80\n\tmax-complexity = 12\n\t...\n\tignore = E501\n\tselect = C,E,F,W,B,B901\n\nNote that we're enabling the complexity checks, the PEP8 ``pycodestyle``\nerrors and warnings, the pyflakes fatals and all default Bugbear checks.\nFinally, we're also specifying B901 as a check that we want enabled.\nSome checks might need other flake8 checks disabled - e.g. E501 must be\ndisabled for B950 to be hit.\n\nIf you'd like all optional warnings to be enabled for you (future proof\nyour config!), say ``B9`` instead of ``B901``. You will need Flake8 3.2+\nfor this feature.\n\nNote that ``pycodestyle`` also has a bunch of warnings that are disabled\nby default.  Those get enabled as soon as there is an ``ignore =`` line\nin your configuration.  I think this behavior is surprising so Bugbear's\nopinionated warnings require explicit selection.\n\n\nTests\n-----\n\nJust run::\n\n    python tests/test_bugbear.py\n\n\nLicense\n-------\n\nMIT\n\n\nChange Log\n----------\n\n21.4.3\n~~~~~~\n\n* Verify the element in item_context.args is of type ast.Name for b017 \n\n21.4.2\n~~~~~~\n\n* Add another hasattr() check to b017 visit for .func\n\n21.4.1\n~~~~~~\n\n* Add B017: check for gotta-catch-em-all assertRaises(Exception)\n\n21.3.2\n~~~~~~\n\n* Fix crash on tuple expansion in try/except block (#161)\n\n21.3.1\n~~~~~~\n\n* Fix grammar in B015 (#150)\n* Make sure float infinity/NaN does not trigger B008 (#155)\n* Handle positional-only args in class methods (#158)\n\n20.11.1\n~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n* Support exception aliases properly in B014 (#129)\n* Add B015: Pointless comparison (#130)\n* Remove check for # noqa comments (#134)\n* Ignore exception classes which are not types (#135)\n* Introduce B016 to check for raising a literal.
