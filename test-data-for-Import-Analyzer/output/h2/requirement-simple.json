It's written from the ground up to be embeddable in whatever program you\nchoose to use, ensuring that you can speak HTTP/2 regardless of your\nprogramming paradigm.\n\nYou use it like this:\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    import h2.connection\n    import h2.config\n\n    config = h2.config.H2Configuration()\n    conn = h2.connection.H2Connection(config=config)\n    conn.send_headers(stream_id=stream_id, headers=headers)\n    conn.send_data(stream_id, data)\n    socket.sendall(conn.data_to_send())\n    events = conn.receive_data(socket_data)\n\nThis repository does not provide a parsing layer, a network layer, or any rules\nabout concurrency. Instead, it's a purely in-memory solution, defined in terms\nof data actions and HTTP/2 frames. This is one building block of a full Python\nHTTP implementation.\n\nTo install it, just run:\n\n.. code-block:: console\n\n    $ pip install h2\n\nDocumentation\n=============\n\nDocumentation is available at https://hyper-h2.readthedocs.io/ .\n\nContributing\n============\n\n``hyper-h2`` welcomes contributions from anyone!
