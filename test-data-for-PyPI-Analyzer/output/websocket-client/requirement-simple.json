It provides access\nto low level APIs for WebSockets. websocket-client implements version\n[hybi-13](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-hybi-thewebsocketprotocol-13)\nof the WebSocket procotol. This client does not currently support the\npermessage-deflate extension from\n[RFC 7692](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7692).\n\n## Documentation\n\nThis project's documentation can be found at\n[https://websocket-client.readthedocs.io/](https://websocket-client.readthedocs.io/)\n\n## Contributing\n\nPlease see the [contribution guidelines](https://github.com/websocket-client/websocket-client/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)\n\n## Installation\n\nFirst, install the following dependencies:\n- six\n- backports.ssl\\_match\\_hostname for Python 2.x\n\nYou can install the dependencies with the command `pip install six` and\n`pip install backports.ssl_match_hostname`\n\nYou can use either `python setup.py install` or `pip install websocket-client`\nto install. This module is tested on Python 2.7 and Python 3.4+. Python 3\nsupport was first introduced in version 0.14.0, but is a work in progress.\n\n## Usage Tips\n\nCheck out the documentation's FAQ for additional guidelines:\n[https://websocket-client.readthedocs.io/en/latest/faq.html](https://websocket-client.readthedocs.io/en/latest/faq.html)\n\nKnown issues with this library include lack of WebSocket Compression\nsupport (RFC 7692) and [minimal threading documentation/support](https://websocket-client.readthedocs.io/en/latest/threading.html).\n\n## License\n\n- LGPL version 2.1\n\n### Performance\n\nThe `send` and `validate_utf8` methods are very slow in pure Python. You can\ndisable UTF8 validation in this library (and receive a performance enhancement)\nwith the `skip_utf8_validation` parameter. If you want to get better\nperformance, please install both numpy and wsaccel, and import them into your\nproject files - these other libraries will automatically be used when available.\nNote that wsaccel can sometimes cause other issues.\n\n### Long-lived Connection\n\nMost real-world WebSockets situations involve longer-lived connections.\nThe WebSocketApp `run_forever` loop automatically tries to reconnect when a\nconnection is lost, and provides a variety of event-based connection controls.\nThe project documentation has\n[additional examples](https://websocket-client.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples.html)\n\n```python\nimport websocket\ntry:\n    import thread\nexcept ImportError:\n    import _thread as thread\nimport time\n\ndef on_message(ws, message):\n    print(message)\n\ndef on_error(ws, error):\n    print(error)\n\ndef on_close(ws):\n    print(\"### closed ###\")\n\ndef on_open(ws):\n    def run(*args):\n        for i in range(3):\n            time.sleep(1)\n            ws.send(\"Hello %d\" % i)\n        time.sleep(1)\n        ws.close()\n        print(\"thread terminating...\")\n    thread.start_new_thread(run, ())\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    websocket.enableTrace(True)\n    ws = websocket.WebSocketApp(\"ws://echo.websocket.org/\",\n                              on_open = on_open,\n                              on_message = on_message,\n                              on_error = on_error,\n                              on_close = on_close)\n\n    ws.run_forever()\n```\n\n### Short-lived Connection\n\nThis is if you want to communicate a short message and disconnect\nimmediately when done. For example, if you want to confirm that a WebSocket\nserver is running and responds properly to a specific request.\nThe project documentation has\n[additional examples](https://websocket-client.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples.html)\n\n```python\nfrom websocket import create_connection\nws = create_connection(\"ws://echo.websocket.org/\")\nprint(\"Sending 'Hello, World'...\")\nws.send(\"Hello, World\")\nprint(\"Sent\")\nprint(\"Receiving...\")\nresult =  ws.recv()\nprint(\"Received '%s'\" % result)\nws.close()\n```\n\nIf you want to customize socket options, set sockopt, as seen below:\n\n```python\nfrom websocket import create_connection\nws = create_connection(\"ws://echo.websocket.org/\",\n                        sockopt=((socket.IPPROTO_TCP, socket.TCP_NODELAY),))\n```\n\n### Acknowledgements\n\nThanks to @battlemidget and @ralphbean for helping migrate this project to\nPython 3.\n\n\n",
