  "description": "Certifi: Python SSL Certificates\n================================\n\n`Certifi`_ provides Mozilla's carefully curated collection of Root Certificates for\nvalidating the trustworthiness of SSL certificates while verifying the identity\nof TLS hosts. It has been extracted from the `Requests`_ project.\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\n``certifi`` is available on PyPI. Simply install it with ``pip``::\n\n    $ pip install certifi\n\nUsage\n-----\n\nTo reference the installed certificate authority (CA) bundle, you can use the\nbuilt-in function::\n\n    >>> import certifi\n\n    >>> certifi.where()\n    '/usr/local/lib/python3.7/site-packages/certifi/cacert.pem'\n\nOr from the command line::\n\n    $ python -m certifi\n    /usr/local/lib/python3.7/site-packages/certifi/cacert.pem\n\nEnjoy!\n\n1024-bit Root Certificates\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nBrowsers and certificate authorities have concluded that 1024-bit keys are\nunacceptably weak for certificates, particularly root certificates. For this\nreason, Mozilla has removed any weak (i.e. 1024-bit key) certificate from its\nbundle, replacing it with an equivalent strong (i.e. 2048-bit or greater key)\ncertificate from the same CA. Because Mozilla removed these certificates from\nits bundle, ``certifi`` removed them as well.\n\nIn previous versions, ``certifi`` provided the ``certifi.old_where()`` function\nto intentionally re-add the 1024-bit roots back into your bundle. This was not\nrecommended in production and therefore was removed at the end of 2018.\n\n.. _`Certifi`: https://certifiio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/\n.. _`Requests`: https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/master/\n\nAddition/Removal of Certificates\n--------------------------------\n\nCertifi does not support any addition/removal or other modification of the\nCA trust store content. This project is intended to provide a reliable and\nhighly portable root of trust to python deployments. Look to upstream projects\nfor methods to use alternate trust.\n\n\n",
