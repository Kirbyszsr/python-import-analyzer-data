  "description": "ruamel.yaml\n===========\n\n``ruamel.yaml`` is a YAML 1.2 loader/dumper package for Python.\n\n:version:       0.17.4\n:updated:       2021-04-07\n:documentation: http://yaml.readthedocs.io\n:repository:    https://sourceforge.net/projects/ruamel-yaml/\n:pypi:          https://pypi.org/project/ruamel.yaml/\n\n*The 0.16.13 release was the last that will tested to be working on Python 2.7.\nThe 0.17 series will still be tested on Python 3.5, but the 0.18 will not. The\n0.17 series will also stop support for the old PyYAML functions, so a `YAML()` instance\nwill need to be created.*\n\n*The 0.17 series will also see changes in how comments are attached during\nroundtrip. This will result in backwards incompatibilities on the `.ca` data and\nit might even be necessary for documented methods that handle comments.*\n\n*Please adjust your dependencies accordingly if necessary. (`ruamel.yaml<0.17`)*\n\n\nStarting with version 0.15.0 the way YAML files are loaded and dumped\nis changing. See the API doc for details.  Currently existing\nfunctionality will throw a warning before being changed/removed.\n**For production systems you should pin the version being used with\n``ruamel.yaml<=0.15``**. There might be bug fixes in the 0.14 series,\nbut new functionality is likely only to be available via the new API.\n\nIf your package uses ``ruamel.yaml`` and is not listed on PyPI, drop\nme an email, preferably with some information on how you use the\npackage (or a link to the repository) and I'll keep you informed\nwhen the status of the API is stable enough to make the transition.\n\n* `Overview <http://yaml.readthedocs.org/en/latest/overview.html>`_\n* `Installing <http://yaml.readthedocs.org/en/latest/install.html>`_\n* `Basic Usage <http://yaml.readthedocs.org/en/latest/basicuse.html>`_\n* `Details <http://yaml.readthedocs.org/en/latest/detail.html>`_\n* `Examples <http://yaml.readthedocs.org/en/latest/example.html>`_\n* `API <http://yaml.readthedocs.org/en/latest/api.html>`_\n* `Differences with PyYAML <http://yaml.readthedocs.org/en/latest/pyyaml.html>`_\n\n.. image:: https://readthedocs.org/projects/yaml/badge/?version=stable\n   :target: https://yaml.readthedocs.org/en/stable\n\n.. image:: https://bestpractices.coreinfrastructure.org/projects/1128/badge\n   :target: https://bestpractices.coreinfrastructure.org/projects/1128\n\n.. image:: https://sourceforge.net/p/ruamel-yaml/code/ci/default/tree/_doc/_static/license.svg?format=raw\n   :target: https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT\n\n.. image:: https://sourceforge.net/p/ruamel-yaml/code/ci/default/tree/_doc/_static/pypi.svg?format=raw\n   :target: https://pypi.org/project/ruamel.yaml/\n\n.. image:: https://sourceforge.net/p/oitnb/code/ci/default/tree/_doc/_static/oitnb.svg?format=raw\n   :target: https://pypi.org/project/oitnb/\n\n.. image:: http://www.mypy-lang.org/static/mypy_badge.svg\n   :target: http://mypy-lang.org/\n\nChangeLog\n=========\n\n.. should insert NEXT: at the beginning of line for next key (with empty line)\n\n0.17.4 (2021-04-07):\n  - prevent (empty) comments from throwing assertion error (issue 351 \n    reported by  `William Kimball <https://sourceforge.net/u/william303/>`__)\n    comments (or empty line) will be dropped \n\n0.17.3 (2021-04-07):\n  - fix for issue 382 caused by an error in a format string (reported by\n    `William Kimball <https://sourceforge.net/u/william303/>`__)\n  - allow expansion of aliases by setting ``yaml.composer.return_alias = lambda s: copy.deepcopy(s)``\n     (as per `Stackoverflow answer <https://stackoverflow.com/a/66983530/1307905>`__)\n\n0.17.2 (2021-03-29):\n  - change -py2.py3-none-any.whl to -py3-none-any.whl, and remove 0.17.1\n\n0.17.1 (2021-03-29):\n   - added 'Programming Language :: Python :: 3 :: Only', and removing\n     0.17.0 from PyPI (reported by `Alasdair Nicol <https://sourceforge.net/u/alasdairnicol/>`__)\n\n0.17.0 (2021-03-26):\n  - removed because of incomplete classifiers\n  - this release no longer supports Python 2.7, most if not all Python 2\n    specific code is removed. The 0.17.x series is the last to  support Python 3.5\n    (this also allowed for removal of the dependency  on ``ruamel.std.pathlib``)\n  - remove Python2 specific code branches and adaptations (u-strings)\n  - prepare % code for f-strings using ``_F``\n  - allow PyOxidisation (`issue 324 <https://sourceforge.net/p/ruamel-yaml/tickets/324/>`__\n    resp. `issue 171 <https://github.com/indygreg/PyOxidizer/issues/171>`__)\n  - replaced Python 2 compatible enforcement of keyword arguments with '*'\n  - the old top level *functions* ``load``, ``safe_load``, ``round_trip_load``,\n    ``dump``, ``safe_dump``, ``round_trip_dump``, ``scan``, ``parse``,\n    ``compose``, ``emit``, ``serialize`` as well as their ``_all`` variants for\n    multi-document streams, now issue a ``PendingDeprecationning`` (e.g. when run\n    from pytest, but also Python is started with ``-Wd``). Use the methods on\n    ``YAML()``, which have been extended.\n  - fix for issue 376: indentation changes could put literal/folded scalar to start\n    before the ``#`` column of a following comment. Effectively making the comment\n    part of the scalar in the output. (reported by\n    `Bence Nagy <https://sourceforge.net/u/underyx/>`__)\n\n\n0.16.13 (2021-03-05):\n  - fix for issue 359: could not update() CommentedMap with keyword arguments\n    (reported by `Steve Franchak <https://sourceforge.net/u/binaryadder/>`__)\n  - fix for issue 365: unable to dump mutated TimeStamp objects\n    (reported by Anton Akmerov <https://sourceforge.net/u/akhmerov/>`__)\n  - fix for issue 371: unable to addd comment without starting space\n    (reported by 'Mark Grandi <https://sourceforge.net/u/mgrandi>`__)\n  - fix for issue 373: recursive call to walk_tree not preserving all params\n    (reported by `eulores <https://sourceforge.net/u/eulores/>`__)\n  - a None value in a flow-style sequence is now dumped as `null` instead\n    of `!!null ''` (reported by mcarans on\n    `StackOverlow <https://stackoverflow.com/a/66489600/1307905>`__)\n\n0.16.12 (2020-09-04):\n  - update links in doc\n\n0.16.11 (2020-09-03):\n  - workaround issue with setuptools 0.50 and importing pip ( fix by jaraco\n    https://github.com/pypa/setuptools/issues/2355#issuecomment-685159580 )\n\n0.16.10 (2020-02-12):\n  - (auto) updated image references in README to sourceforge\n\n0.16.9 (2020-02-11):\n  - update CHANGES\n\n0.16.8 (2020-02-11):\n  - update requirements so that ruamel.yaml.clib is installed for 3.8,\n    as it has become available (via manylinux builds)\n\n0.16.7 (2020-01-30):\n  - fix typchecking issue on TaggedScalar (reported by Jens Nielsen)\n  - fix error in dumping literal scalar in sequence with comments before element\n    (reported by `EJ Etherington <https://sourceforge.net/u/ejether/>`__)\n\n0.16.6 (2020-01-20):\n  - fix empty string mapping key roundtripping with preservation of quotes as `?
