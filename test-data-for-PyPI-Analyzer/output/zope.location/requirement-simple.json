Also added a test suite that fully tests the pure Python proxy\n  version of the ``LocationProxy`` class.\n\n\n4.0.1 (2013-02-19)\n==================\n\n- Add Python 3.3 support.\n\n4.0.0 (2012-06-07)\n==================\n\n- Remove backward-compatibility imports:\n\n  - ``zope.copy.clone`` (aliased as ``zope.location.pickling.locationCopy``)\n\n  - ``zope.copy.CopyPersistent`` (aliased as\n    ``zope.location.pickling.CopyPersistent``).\n\n  - ``zope.site.interfaces.IPossibleSite`` (aliased as\n    ``zope.location.interfaces.IPossibleSite``).\n\n- Add Python 3.2 support.\n\n- Make ``zope.component`` dependency optional.  Use the ``component`` extra\n  to force its installation (or just require it directly).  If\n  ``zope.component`` is not present, this package defines the ``ISite``\n  interface itself, and omits adapter registrations from its ZCML.\n\n- Add support for PyPy.\n\n- Add support for continuous integration using ``tox`` and ``jenkins``.\n\n- Bring unit test coverage to 100%.\n\n- Add Sphinx documentation:  moved doctest examples to API reference.\n\n- Add 'setup.py docs' alias (installs ``Sphinx`` and dependencies).\n\n- Add 'setup.py dev' alias (runs ``setup.py develop`` plus installs\n  ``nose`` and ``coverage``).\n\n- Replace deprecated ``zope.component.adapts`` usage with equivalent\n  ``zope.component.adapter`` decorator.\n\n- Replace deprecated ``zope.interface.implements`` usage with equivalent\n  ``zope.interface.implementer`` decorator.\n\n- Drop support for Python 2.4 and 2.5.\n\n\n3.9.1 (2011-08-22)\n==================\n\n- Add zcml extra as well as a test for configure.zcml.\n\n\n3.9.0 (2009-12-29)\n==================\n\n- Move LocationCopyHook related tests to zope.copy and remove a test\n  dependency on that package.\n\n3.8.2 (2009-12-23)\n==================\n\n- Fix a typo in the configure.zcml.\n\n3.8.1 (2009-12-23)\n==================\n\n- Remove dependency on zope.copy: the LocationCopyHook adapter is registered\n  only if zope.copy is available.\n\n- Use the standard Python doctest module instead of zope.testing.doctest, which\n  has been deprecated.\n\n3.8.0 (2009-12-22)\n==================\n\n- Adjust to testing output caused by new zope.schema.\n\n3.7.1 (2009-11-18)\n==================\n\n- Move the IPossibleSite and ISite interfaces to zope.component as they are\n  dealing with zope.component's concept of a site, but not with location.\n\n3.7.0 (2009-09-29)\n==================\n\n- Add getParent() to ILocationInfo and moved the actual implementation here\n  from zope.traversal.api, analogous to getParents().\n\n- Actually remove deprecated PathPersistent class from\n  zope.location.pickling.\n\n- Move ITraverser back to zope.traversing where it belongs conceptually. The\n  interface had been moved to zope.location to invert the package\n  interdependency but is no longer used here.\n\n3.6.0 (2009-08-27)\n==================\n\n- New feature release: deprecate locationCopy, CopyPersistent and\n  PathPersistent from zope.location.pickling. These changes were already part\n  of the 3.5.3 release, which was erroneously numbered as a bugfix relese.\n\n- Remove dependency on zope.deferredimport, directly import deprecated modules\n  without using it.\n\n3.5.5 (2009-08-15)\n==================\n\n- Add zope.deferredimport as a dependency as it's used directly by\n  zope.location.pickling.\n\n3.5.4 (2009-05-17)\n==================\n\n- Add ``IContained`` interface to ``zope.location.interfaces`` module.\n  This interface was moved from ``zope.container`` (after\n  ``zope.container`` 3.8.2); consumers of ``IContained`` may now\n  depend on zope.location rather than zope.container to reduce\n  dependency cycles.\n\n3.5.3 (2009-02-09)\n==================\n\n- Use new zope.copy package for implementing location copying. Thus\n  there's changes in the ``zope.locaton.pickling`` module:\n\n   * The ``locationCopy`` and ``CopyPersistent`` was removed in prefer\n     to their equivalents in zope.copy. Deprecated backward-compatibility\n     imports provided.\n\n   * The module now provides a ``zope.copy.interfaces.ICopyHook`` adapter\n     for ``ILocation`` objects that replaces the old CopyPersistent\n     functionality of checking for the need to clone objects based on\n     their location.\n\n3.5.2 (2009-02-04)\n==================\n\n- Split RootPhysicallyLocatable adapter back from LocationPhysicallyLocatable,\n  because the IRoot object may not always provide ILocation and the code\n  for the root object is also simplier. It's basically a copy of the\n  RootPhysicallyLocatable adapter from zope.traversing version 3.5.0 and\n  below with ``getParents`` method added (returns an empty list).\n\n3.5.1 (2009-02-02)\n==================\n\n- Improve test coverage.\n\n- The new ``getParents`` method was extracted from ``zope.traversing``\n  and added to ILocationInfo interface in the previous release. Custom\n  ILocationInfo implementations should make sure they have this method\n  as well. That method is already used in ``zope.traversing.api.getParents``\n  function.\n\n- Make ``getName`` of LocationPhysicallyLocatable always return empty\n  string for the IRoot object, like RootPhysicallyLocatable from\n  ``zope.traversing`` did. So, now LocationPhysicallyLocatable is\n  fully compatible with RootPhysicallyLocatable, making the latter one\n  obsolete.\n\n- Change package mailing list address to zope-dev at zope.org instead\n  of retired zope3-dev at zope.org.\n\n3.5.0 (2009-01-31)\n==================\n\n- Reverse the dependency between zope.location and zope.traversing. This\n  also causes the dependency to various other packages go away.\n\n3.4.0 (2007-10-02)\n==================\n\n- Initial release independent of the main Zope tree.\n\n\n",
