  "description": "Beautiful Soup is a library that makes it easy to scrape information\nfrom web pages. It sits atop an HTML or XML parser, providing Pythonic\nidioms for iterating, searching, and modifying the parse tree.\n\n# Quick start\n\n```\n>>> from bs4 import BeautifulSoup\n>>> soup = BeautifulSoup(\"<p>Some<b>bad<i>HTML\")\n>>> print(soup.prettify())\n<html>\n <body>\n  <p>\n   Some\n   <b>\n    bad\n    <i>\n     HTML\n    </i>\n   </b>\n  </p>\n </body>\n</html>\n>>> soup.find(text=\"bad\")\n'bad'\n>>> soup.i\n<i>HTML</i>\n#\n>>> soup = BeautifulSoup(\"<tag1>Some<tag2/>bad<tag3>XML\", \"xml\")\n#\n>>> print(soup.prettify())\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?>\n<tag1>\n Some\n <tag2/>\n bad\n <tag3>\n  XML\n </tag3>\n</tag1>\n```\n\nTo go beyond the basics, [comprehensive documentation is available](http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/).\n\n# Links\n\n* [Homepage](http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/)\n* [Documentation](http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/)\n* [Discussion group](http://groups.google.com/group/beautifulsoup/)\n* [Development](https://code.launchpad.net/beautifulsoup/)\n* [Bug tracker](https://bugs.launchpad.net/beautifulsoup/)\n* [Complete changelog](https://bazaar.launchpad.net/~leonardr/beautifulsoup/bs4/view/head:/CHANGELOG)\n\n# Note on Python 2 sunsetting\n\nSince 2012, Beautiful Soup has been developed as a Python 2 library\nwhich is automatically converted to Python 3 code as necessary. This\nmakes it impossible to take advantage of some features of Python\n3.\n\nFor this reason, I plan to discontinue Beautiful Soup's Python 2\nsupport at some point after December 31, 2020: one year after the\nsunset date for Python 2 itself. Beyond that point, new Beautiful Soup\ndevelopment will exclusively target Python 3. Of course, older\nreleases of Beautiful Soup, which support both versions, will continue\nto be available.\n\n# Supporting the project\n\nIf you use Beautiful Soup as part of your professional work, please consider a\n[Tidelift subscription](https://tidelift.com/subscription/pkg/pypi-beautifulsoup4?utm_source=pypi-beautifulsoup4&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=readme).\nThis will support many of the free software projects your organization\ndepends on, not just Beautiful Soup.\n\nIf you use Beautiful Soup for personal projects, the best way to say\nthank you is to read\n[Tool Safety](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/zine/), a zine I\nwrote about what Beautiful Soup has taught me about software\ndevelopment.\n\n# Building the documentation\n\nThe bs4/doc/ directory contains full documentation in Sphinx\nformat. Run `make html` in that directory to create HTML\ndocumentation.\n\n# Running the unit tests\n\nBeautiful Soup supports unit test discovery from the project root directory:\n\n```\n$ nosetests\n```\n\n```\n$ python -m unittest discover -s bs4\n```\n\nIf you checked out the source tree, you should see a script in the\nhome directory called test-all-versions. This script will run the unit\ntests under Python 2, then create a temporary Python 3 conversion of\nthe source and run the unit tests again under Python 3.\n\n\n",
