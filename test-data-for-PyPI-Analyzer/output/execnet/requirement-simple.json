It provides\na minimal and fast API targetting the following uses:\n\n* distribute tasks to local or remote processes\n* write and deploy hybrid multi-process applications\n* write scripts to administer multiple hosts\n\nFeatures\n------------------\n\n* zero-install bootstrapping: no remote installation required!\n\n* flexible communication: send/receive as well as\n  callback/queue mechanisms supported\n\n* simple serialization of python builtin types (no pickling)\n\n* grouped creation and robust termination of processes\n\n* interoperable between Windows and Unix-ish systems.\n\n* integrates with different threading models, including standard\n  os threads, eventlet and gevent based systems.\n\n\n",
