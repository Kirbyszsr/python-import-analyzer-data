It uses the LLVM compiler project to generate machine code\nfrom Python syntax.\n\nNumba can compile a large subset of numerically-focused Python, including many\nNumPy functions.  Additionally, Numba has support for automatic\nparallelization of loops, generation of GPU-accelerated code, and creation of\nufuncs and C callbacks.\n\nFor more information about Numba, see the Numba homepage:\nhttps://numba.pydata.org\n\nSupported Platforms\n===================\n\n* Operating systems and CPUs:\n\n  - Linux: x86 (32-bit), x86_64, ppc64le (POWER8 and 9), ARMv7 (32-bit),\n    ARMv8 (64-bit)\n  - Windows: x86, x86_64\n  - macOS: x86_64, (M1/Arm64, unofficial support only)\n  - \\*BSD: (unofficial support only)\n\n* (Optional) Accelerators and GPUs:\n\n  * NVIDIA GPUs (Kepler architecture or later) via CUDA driver on Linux, Windows,\n    macOS (< 10.14)\n  * AMD GPUs via ROCm driver on Linux\n\nDependencies\n============\n\n* Python versions: 3.6-3.9\n* llvmlite 0.36.*\n* NumPy >=1.15 (can build with 1.11 for ABI compatibility)\n\nOptionally:\n\n* SciPy >=1.0.0 (for ``numpy.linalg`` support)\n\n\nInstalling\n==========\n\nThe easiest way to install Numba and get updates is by using the Anaconda\nDistribution: https://www.anaconda.com/download\n\n::\n\n   $ conda install numba\n\nFor more options, see the Installation Guide: https://numba.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user/installing.html\n\nDocumentation\n=============\n\nhttps://numba.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html\n\n\nMailing Lists\n=============\n\nJoin the Numba mailing list numba-users@continuum.io:\nhttps://groups.google.com/a/continuum.io/d/forum/numba-users\n\nSome old archives are at: http://librelist.com/browser/numba/\n\n\nContinuous Integration\n======================\n\n.. image:: https://dev.azure.com/numba/numba/_apis/build/status/numba.numba?branchName=master\n    :target: https://dev.azure.com/numba/numba/_build/latest?definitionId=1?branchName=master\n    :alt: Azure Pipelines\n\n\n",
