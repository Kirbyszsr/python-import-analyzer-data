  "description": "\nThe h5py package provides both a high- and low-level interface to the HDF5\nlibrary from Python. The low-level interface is intended to be a complete\nwrapping of the HDF5 API, while the high-level component supports  access to\nHDF5 files, datasets and groups using established Python and NumPy concepts.\n\nA strong emphasis on automatic conversion between Python (Numpy) datatypes and\ndata structures and their HDF5 equivalents vastly simplifies the process of\nreading and writing data from Python.\n\nSupports HDF5 versions 1.8.4 and higher.  On Windows, HDF5 is included with\nthe installer.\n\n\n",
