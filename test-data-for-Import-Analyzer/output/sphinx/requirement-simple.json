It was originally created\nfor the new Python documentation, and has excellent facilities for Python\nproject documentation, but C/C++ is supported as well, and more languages are\nplanned.\n\nSphinx uses reStructuredText as its markup language, and many of its strengths\ncome from the power and straightforwardness of reStructuredText and its parsing\nand translating suite, the Docutils.\n\nAmong its features are the following:\n\n* Output formats: HTML (including derivative formats such as HTML Help, Epub\n  and Qt Help), plain text, manual pages and LaTeX or direct PDF output\n  using rst2pdf\n* Extensive cross-references: semantic markup and automatic links\n  for functions, classes, glossary terms and similar pieces of information\n* Hierarchical structure: easy definition of a document tree, with automatic\n  links to siblings, parents and children\n* Automatic indices: general index as well as a module index\n* Code handling: automatic highlighting using the Pygments highlighter\n* Flexible HTML output using the Jinja 2 templating engine\n* Various extensions are available, e.g. for automatic testing of snippets\n  and inclusion of appropriately formatted docstrings\n* Setuptools integration\n\nFor more information, refer to the `the documentation`__.\n\n.. __: http://www.sphinx-doc.org/\n\nInstallation\n============\n\nSphinx is published on `PyPI`__ and can be installed from there::\n\n   pip install -U sphinx\n\nWe also publish beta releases::\n\n   pip install -U --pre sphinx\n\nIf you wish to install `Sphinx` for development purposes, refer to `the\ncontributors guide`__.\n\n__ https://pypi.org/project/Sphinx/\n__ http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/internals/contributing.html\n\nDocumentation\n=============\n\nDocumentation is available from `sphinx-doc.org`__.\n\n__ http://www.sphinx-doc.org/\n\nGet in touch\n============\n\n- Report bugs, suggest features or view the source code `on GitHub`_.\n- For less well defined questions or ideas, use the `mailing list`_.\n\n.. _on GitHub: https://github.com/sphinx-doc/sphinx\n.. _mailing list: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/sphinx-users\n\nPlease adhere to our `code of conduct`__.\n\n__ http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/code_of_conduct.html\n\nTesting\n=======\n\nContinuous testing is provided by `Travis`__ (for unit tests and style checks\non Linux), `AppVeyor`__ (for unit tests on Windows), and `CircleCI`__ (for\nlarge processes like TeX compilation).\n\nFor information on running tests locally, refer to `the contributors guide`__.\n\n__ https://travis-ci.org/sphinx-doc/sphinx\n__ https://ci.appveyor.com/project/sphinxdoc/sphinx\n__ https://circleci.com/gh/sphinx-doc/sphinx\n__ http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/internals/contributing.html\n\nContributing\n============\n\nRefer to `the contributors guide`__.\n\n__ http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/internals/contributing.html\n\nRelease signatures\n==================\n\nReleases are signed with following keys:\n\n* `498D6B9E <https://pgp.mit.edu/pks/lookup?op=vindex&search=0x102C2C17498D6B9E>`_\n* `5EBA0E07 <https://pgp.mit.edu/pks/lookup?op=vindex&search=0x1425F8CE5EBA0E07>`_\n\n\n",
