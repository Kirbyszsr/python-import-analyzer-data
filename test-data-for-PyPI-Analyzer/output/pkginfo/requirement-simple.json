  "description": "``pkginfo`` README\n==================\n\nThis package provides an API for querying the distutils metadata written in\nthe ``PKG-INFO`` file inside a source distriubtion (an ``sdist``) or a\nbinary distribution (e.g., created by running ``bdist_egg``).  It can\nalso query the ``EGG-INFO`` directory of an installed distribution, and\nthe ``*.egg-info`` stored in a \"development checkout\"\n(e.g, created by running ``setup.py develop``).\n\n\nPlease see the `pkginfo docs <http://packages.python.org/pkginfo>`_\nfor detailed documentation.\n\n\n``pkginfo`` Changelog\n=====================\n\n1.7.0 (2021-01-16)\n------------------\n\n- Add support for Python 3.9\n\n- Drop support for Python 3.5.\n\n1.6.1 (2020-10-26)\n------------------\n\n- Adjust test classifiers to match supported Python versions.

Ensured that distributions \"unfold\" wrapped\n  continuation lines, stripping any leading / trailing whitespace, no matter\n  which module was used for parsing.\n\n- Remove bogus testing dependency on ``zope.testing``.\n\n- Add tests that the \"environment markers\" spelled out in the approved\n  PEP 345 are captured.\n\n- Add ``Project-URL`` for ``1.2`` PKG-INFO metdata (defined in the accepted\n  version of PEP 345).\n\n\n0.5 (2009-09-11)\n----------------\n\n- Marked package as non-zip-safe.\n\n- Fix Trove metadata misspelling.\n\n- Restore compatibility with Python 2.4.\n\n- Note that the introspection of installed packages / modules works only\n  in Python 2.6 or later.\n\n- Add ``Index`` class as an abstraction over a collection of distributions.\n\n- Add ``download_url_prefix`` argument to ``pkginfo`` script.  If passed,\n  the script will use the prefix to synthesize a ``download_url`` for\n  distributions which do not supply that value directly.\n\n\n0.4.1 (2009-05-07)\n------------------\n\n- Fix bugs in handling of installed packages which lack ``__file__``\n  or ``PKG-INFO``.\n\n\n0.4 (2009-05-07)\n----------------\n\n- Extend the console script to allow output as CSV or INI.  Also, added\n  arguments to specify the metadata version and other parsing / output\n  policies.\n\n- Add support for the different metadata versions specified in PEPs\n  241, 314, and 345.  Distributions now parse and expose only the attributes\n  corresponding to their metadata version, which defaults to the version\n  parsed from the ``PKG-INFO`` file.  The programmer can override that version\n  when creating the distribution object.\n\n\n0.3 (2009-05-07)\n----------------\n\n- Add support for introspection of \"development eggs\" (checkouts with\n  ``PKG-INFO``, perhaps created via ``setup.py develop``).\n\n- Add a console script, ``pkginfo``, which takes one or more paths\n  on the command line and writes out the associated information.  Thanks\n  to ``runeh`` for the patch!\n\n- Add ``get_metadata`` helper function, which dispatches a given path or\n  module across the available distribution types, and returns a distribution\n  object.  Thanks to ``runeh`` for the patch!\n\n- Make distribution objects support iteration over the metadata fields.\n  Thanks to ``runeh`` for the patch!\n\n- Make ``Distribution`` and subclasses new-style classes.  Thanks to ``runeh``\n  for the patch!\n\n\n0.2 (2009-04-14)\n----------------\n\n- Add support for introspection of ``bdist_egg`` binary distributions.\n\n\n0.1.1 (2009-04-10)\n------------------\n\n- Fix packaging errors.\n\n\n0.1 (2009-04-10)\n----------------\n\n- Initial release.\n\n\n",
