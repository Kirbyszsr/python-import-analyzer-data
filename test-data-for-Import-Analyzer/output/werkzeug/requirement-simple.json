  "description": "Werkzeug\n========\n\n*werkzeug* German noun: \"tool\". Etymology: *werk* (\"work\"), *zeug* (\"stuff\")\n\nWerkzeug is a comprehensive `WSGI`_ web application library. It began as\na simple collection of various utilities for WSGI applications and has\nbecome one of the most advanced WSGI utility libraries.\n\nIt includes:\n\n-   An interactive debugger that allows inspecting stack traces and\n    source code in the browser with an interactive interpreter for any\n    frame in the stack.\n-   A full-featured request object with objects to interact with\n    headers, query args, form data, files, and cookies.\n-   A response object that can wrap other WSGI applications and handle\n    streaming data.\n-   A routing system for matching URLs to endpoints and generating URLs\n    for endpoints, with an extensible system for capturing variables\n    from URLs.\n-   HTTP utilities to handle entity tags, cache control, dates, user\n    agents, cookies, files, and more.\n-   A threaded WSGI server for use while developing applications\n    locally.\n-   A test client for simulating HTTP requests during testing without\n    requiring running a server.\n\nWerkzeug doesn't enforce any dependencies. It is up to the developer to\nchoose a template engine, database adapter, and even how to handle\nrequests. It can be used to build all sorts of end user applications\nsuch as blogs, wikis, or bulletin boards.\n\n`Flask`_ wraps Werkzeug, using it to handle the details of WSGI while\nproviding more structure and patterns for defining powerful\napplications.\n\n.. _WSGI: https://wsgi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/\n.. _Flask: https://www.palletsprojects.com/p/flask/\n\n\nInstalling\n----------\n\nInstall and update using `pip`_:\n\n.. code-block:: text\n\n    pip install -U Werkzeug\n\n.. _pip: https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/quickstart/\n\n\nA Simple Example\n----------------\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    from werkzeug.wrappers import Request, Response\n\n    @Request.application\n    def application(request):\n        return Response('Hello, World!')\n\n    if __name__ == '__main__':\n        from werkzeug.serving import run_simple\n        run_simple('localhost', 4000, application)\n\n\nDonate\n------\n\nThe Pallets organization develops and supports Werkzeug and other\npopular packages.
