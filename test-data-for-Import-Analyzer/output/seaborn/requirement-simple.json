  "description": "Seaborn is a library for making statistical graphics in Python. It is built on top of `matplotlib <https://matplotlib.org/>`_ and closely integrated with `pandas <https://pandas.pydata.org/>`_ data structures.\n\nHere is some of the functionality that seaborn offers:\n\n- A dataset-oriented API for examining relationships between multiple variables\n- Specialized support for using categorical variables to show observations or aggregate statistics\n- Options for visualizing univariate or bivariate distributions and for comparing them between subsets of data\n- Automatic estimation and plotting of linear regression models for different kinds dependent variables\n- Convenient views onto the overall structure of complex datasets\n- High-level abstractions for structuring multi-plot grids that let you easily build complex visualizations\n- Concise control over matplotlib figure styling with several built-in themes\n- Tools for choosing color palettes that faithfully reveal patterns in your data\n\nSeaborn aims to make visualization a central part of exploring and understanding data. Its dataset-oriented plotting functions operate on dataframes and arrays containing whole datasets and internally perform the necessary semantic mapping and statistical aggregation to produce informative plots.\n\n\n",
