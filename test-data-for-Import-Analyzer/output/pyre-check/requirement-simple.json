Pyre can analyze codebases with millions of lines of code incrementally \u2013 providing instantaneous feedback to developers as they write code.\n\nPyre ships with **Pysa**, a security focused static analysis tool we've built on top of Pyre that reasons about data flows in Python applications. Please refer to our [documentation](https://pyre-check.org/docs/pysa-quickstart) to get started with our security analysis.\n\n## Requirements\nTo get started, you need [Python 3.6 or later](https://www.python.org/getit/) and [watchman](https://facebook.github.io/watchman/) working on your system. On *MacOS* you can get everything with [homebrew](https://brew.sh/):\n```bash\n$ brew install python3 watchman\n```\nOn *Ubuntu*, *Mint*, or *Debian*; use `apt-get` and [homebrew](https://brew.sh/):\n```bash\n$ sudo apt-get install python3 python3-pip python3-venv\n$ brew install watchman\n```\nWe tested Pyre on *Ubuntu 18.04.5 LTS*, *CentOS 7*, as well as *OSX 10.11* and later.\n\n## Setting up a Project\nWe start by creating an empty project directory and setting up a virtual environment:\n\n```bash\n$ mkdir my_project && cd my_project\n$ python3 -m venv ~/.venvs/venv\n$ source ~/.venvs/venv/bin/activate\n(venv) $ pip install pyre-check\n```\n\nNext, we teach Pyre about our new project:\n```bash\n(venv) $ pyre init\n```\nThis command will set up a configuration for Pyre (`.pyre_configuration`) as well as watchman (`.watchmanconfig`) in your project's directory. Accept the defaults for now \u2013 you can change them later if necessary.\n\n## Running Pyre\nWe are now ready to run Pyre:\n```bash\n(venv) $ echo \"i: int = 'string'\" > test.py\n(venv) $ pyre\n \u019b Found 1 type error!\ntest.py:1:0 Incompatible variable type [9]: i is declared to have type `int` but is used as type `str`.\n```\nThis first invocation will start a daemon listening for filesystem changes \u2013\u00a0type checking your project incrementally as you make edits to the code. You will notice that subsequent invocations of `pyre` will be faster than the first one.\n\nFor more detailed documentation, see https://pyre-check.org.\n\n## Join the Pyre community\n\nSee [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for how to help out.\n\n## License\n\nPyre is licensed under the MIT license.\n\n\n",
