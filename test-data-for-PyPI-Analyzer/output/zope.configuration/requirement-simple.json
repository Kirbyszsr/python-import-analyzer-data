Users of the\nconfiguration system provide configuration directives in some\nlanguage that express configuration choices. The intent is that the\nlanguage be pluggable.  An XML language is provided by default.\n\nPlease see http://zopeconfiguration.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ for the documentation.\n\n\n\n\nChanges\n=======\n\n4.4.0 (2020-03-22)\n------------------\n\n- Ensure a consistent interface resolution order for all objects. See\n  `issue 49 <https://github.com/zopefoundation/zope.configuration/issues/49>`_.\n\n- Drop support for Python 3.4.\n\n- Add support for Python 3.8.\n\n\n4.3.1 (2019-02-12)\n------------------\n\n- Do not break when running the tests from a wheel.\n\n\n4.3.0 (2018-10-01)\n------------------\n\n- Simplify exception chaining and nested exception error messages.\n  See `issue 43 <https://github.com/zopefoundation/zope.configuration/issues/43>`_.\n\n\n4.2.2 (2018-09-27)\n------------------\n\n- Fix ``GlobalObject`` (and ``GlobalInterface``) no longer allowing\n  multiple leading dots. See `issue 41\n  <https://github.com/zopefoundation/zope.configuration/issues/41>`_.\n\n- Add ``__all__`` to all modules listing the documented members of\n  the module. Note that this is currently a broad list and may be\n  reduced in the future.\n\n\n4.2.1 (2018-09-26)\n------------------\n\n- Fix ``GlobalObject`` (and ``GlobalInterface``) no longer allowing\n  just a single '.'. See `issue 35\n  <https://github.com/zopefoundation/zope.configuration/issues/35>`_.\n\n\n4.2.0 (2018-09-26)\n------------------\n\n- Reach 100% automated test coverage.\n\n- Add support for Python 3.7.\n\n- Drop support for Python 3.3 and remove internal compatibility\n  functions needed to support it. See `issue 20\n  <https://github.com/zopefoundation/zope.configuration/issues/20>`_\n  and `issue 26\n  <https://github.com/zopefoundation/zope.configuration/issues/26>`_.\n\n- Drop support for ``python setup.py test``.\n\n- Make ``zope.configuration.fields.Path`` and\n  ``zope.configuration.config.ConfigurationContext`` expand\n  environment variables and expand user home directories in paths. See\n  `issue 3 <https://github.com/zopefoundation/zope.configuration/issues/3>`_.\n\n- Fix resolving names from a Python 2 package whose ``__init__.py`` has\n  unicode elements in ``__all__``.\n\n- Make ``GroupingContextDecorator`` stop shadowing builtins in its\n  ``__getattr__``. These were not intended as arguments to be used by\n  subclasses, and the signature caused confusion.\n\n- Fix the doctests with zope.schema 4.7 and above, and run the\n  doctests on both Python 2 and Python 3. See `issue 21\n  <https://github.com/zopefoundation/zope.configuration/issues/21>`_.\n\n- Fix ``GlobalObject`` and ``GlobalInterface`` fields to only accept\n  dotted names instead of names with ``/``. Previously, slash\n  delimited names could result in incorrect imports. See `issue 6\n  <https://github.com/zopefoundation/zope.configuration/issues/6>`_.\n\n- Fix the schema fields to include the ``value`` and ``field`` values\n  on exceptions they raise.\n\n- Make ``zope.configuration.fields.PythonIdentifier`` subclass\n  ``PythonIdentifier`` from ``zope.schema``. It now implements ``fromBytes``,\n  always produces a native string, and validates the value in\n  ``fromUnicode``. See `issue 28\n  <https://github.com/zopefoundation/zope.configuration/issues/28>`_.\n\n- Add ``ConfigurationMachine.pass_through_exceptions`` to allow\n  customizing the exceptions that\n  ``ConfigurationMachine.execute_actions`` wraps in a\n  ``ConfigurationExecutionError``. See `issue 10\n  <https://github.com/zopefoundation/zope.configuration/issues/10>`_.\n\n- Stop catching ``BaseException`` and wrapping it in either\n  ``ConfigurationExecutionError`` or ``ZopeXMLConfigurationError``.\n  ``SystemExit`` and ``KeyboardInterrupt`` were always allowed to\n  propagate; now ``GeneratorExit`` and custom subclasses of\n  ``BaseException`` are also allowed te propagate.\n\n4.1.0 (2017-04-26)\n------------------\n\n- Drop support for Python 2.6 and 3.2.\n\n- Add support for Python 3.5 and 3.6.\n\n- Fix the ``domain`` of MessageID fields to be a native string.\n  Previously on Python 3 they were bytes, which meant that they\n  couldn't be used to find translation utilities registered by\n  zope.i18n. See `issue 17 <https://github.com/zopefoundation/zope.configuration/issues/17>`_.\n\n4.0.3 (2014-03-19)\n------------------\n\n- Add explicit support for Python 3.4.\n\n4.0.2 (2012-12-31)\n------------------\n\n- Flesh out PyPI Trove classifiers.\n\n- Remove spurious declaration of 'test' dependency on ``zope.testing``.\n\n4.0.1 (2012-11-21)\n------------------\n\n- Add support for Python 3.3.\n\n- Remove the deprecated 'zope.configuration.stxdocs' script.\n  and made the 'zope.configuration.tests.conditions' helper module\n  (used in running Sphinx doctest snippets) Py3k compatible.\n  https://bugs.launchpad.net/zope.configuration/+bug/1025390\n\n4.0.0 (2012-05-16)\n------------------\n\n- Bring unit test coverage to 100%.\n\n- Automate build of Sphinx HTML docs and running doctest snippets via tox.\n\n- Drop hard testing dependency on ``zope.testing``.\n\n- Add explicit support for PyPy.\n\n- Add explicit support for Python 3.2.\n\n- Drop explicit support for Python 2.4 / 2.5.\n\n- Add support for continuous integration using ``tox`` and ``jenkins``.\n\n- Add ``Sphinx`` documentation.\n\n- Add ``setup.py docs`` alias (installs ``Sphinx`` and dependencies).\n\n- Add ``setup.py dev`` alias (runs ``setup.py develop`` plus installs\n  ``nose`` and ``coverage``).\n\n3.8.1 (2012-05-05)\n------------------\n\n- Fix Python 2.4 backwards incompat (itemgetter used with multiple args);\n  Python 2.4 now works (at least if you use zope.schema == 3.8.1).\n  This is the last release which will support Python 2.4 or 2.5.\n\n3.8.0 (2011-12-06)\n------------------\n\n- Change action structures from tuples to dictionaries to allow for action\n  structure extensibility (merged chrism-dictactions branch).\n\n3.7.4 (2011-04-03)\n------------------\n\n- Apply test fixes for Windows.\n\n3.7.3 (2011-03-11)\n------------------\n\n- Correctly locate packages with a __path__ attribute but no\n  __file__ attribute (such as namespace packages installed with setup.py\n  install --single-version-externally-managed).\n\n- Allow \"info\" and \"includepath\" to be passed optionally to context.action.\n\n3.7.2 (2010-04-30)\n------------------\n\n- Prefer the standard libraries doctest module over zope.testing.doctest.\n\n3.7.1 (2010-01-05)\n------------------\n\n- Jython support: use ``__builtin__`` module import rather than assuming\n  ``__builtins__`` is available.\n\n- Jython support: deal with the fact that the Jython SAX parser\n  returns attribute sets that have an empty string indicating no\n  namespace instead of ``None``.\n\n- Allow ``setup.py test`` to run at least a subset of the tests that\n  would be run when using the zope testrunner: ``setup.py test`` runs\n  53 tests, while ``bin/test`` runs 156.\n\n3.7.0 (2009-12-22)\n------------------\n\n- Adjust testing output to newer zope.schema.\n\n- Prefer zope.testing.doctest over doctestunit.\n\n3.6.0 (2009-04-01)\n------------------\n\n- Removed dependency of `zope.deprecation` package.\n\n- Don't suppress deprecation warnings any more in 'zope.configuration'\n  package level. This makes it more likely other packages will generate\n  deprecation warnings now, which will allow us to remove more\n  outdated ones.\n\n- Don't fail when zope.testing is not installed.\n\n- Added missing ``processFile`` method to ``IConfigurationContext``.\n  It is already implemented in the mix-in class,\n  ``zope.configuration.config.ConfigurationContext``, and used by\n  implementations of ``include`` and ``exclude`` directives.\n\n3.5.0 (2009-02-26)\n------------------\n\n- Added the ``exclude`` directive to standard directives. It was\n  previously available via ``zc.configuration`` package and now it's\n  merged into ``zope.configuration``.\n\n- Changed package's mailing list address to zope-dev at zope.org,\n  change \"cheeseshop\" to \"pypi\" in the package's url.\n\n3.4.1 (2008-12-11)\n------------------\n\n- Use built-in 'set' type, rather than importin the 'sets' module,\n  which is deprecated in Python 2.6.\n\n- Added support to bootstrap on Jython.\n\n3.4.0 (2007-10-02)\n------------------\n\n- Initial release as a standalone package.\n\nBefore 3.4.0\n------------\n\nThis package was part of the Zope 3 distribution and did not have its own\nCHANGES.txt. For earlier changes please refer to either our subversion log or\nthe CHANGES.txt of earlier Zope 3 releases.\n\n\n",
