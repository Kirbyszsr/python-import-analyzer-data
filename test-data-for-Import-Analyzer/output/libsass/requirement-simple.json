That means you can add just ``libsass`` into\nyour ``setup.py``'s ``install_requires`` list or ``requirements.txt`` file.\nNeed no Ruby nor Node.js.\n\nIt currently supports CPython 2.7, 3.6--3.8, and PyPy 2.3+!\n\n.. _Sass: https://sass-lang.com/\n.. _LibSass: https://github.com/sass/libsass\n\n\nFeatures\n--------\n\n- You don't need any Ruby/Node.js stack at all, for development or deployment\n  either.\n- Fast. (LibSass_ is written in C++.)\n- Simple API.  See the below example code for details.\n- Custom functions.\n- ``@import`` callbacks.\n- Support both tabbed (Sass) and braces (SCSS) syntax.\n- WSGI middleware for ease of development.\n  It automatically compiles Sass/SCSS files for each request.\n- ``setuptools``/``distutils`` integration.\n  You can build all Sass/SCSS files using\n  ``setup.py build_sass`` command.\n- Works also on PyPy.\n- Provides prebuilt wheel_ binaries for Linux, Windows, and Mac.\n\n.. _wheel: https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0427/\n\n\nInstall\n-------\n\nIt's available on PyPI_, so you can install it using ``pip`` (or\n``easy_install``):\n\n.. code-block:: console\n\n   $ pip install libsass\n\n.. note::\n\n   libsass requires some features introduced by the recent C++ standard.\n   You need a C++ compiler that support those features.\n   See also libsass project's README_ file.\n\n.. _PyPI: https://pypi.org/pypi/libsass/\n.. _README: https://github.com/sass/libsass#readme\n\n\n.. _example:\n\nExample\n-------\n\n.. code-block:: pycon\n\n   >>> import sass\n   >>> print sass.compile(string='a { b { color: blue; } }')\n   a b {\n     color: blue; }\n\n\nDocs\n----\n\nThere's the user guide manual and the full API reference for ``libsass``:\n\nhttps://sass.github.io/libsass-python/\n\nYou can build the docs by yourself:\n\n.. code-block:: console\n\n   $ cd docs/\n   $ make html\n\nThe built docs will go to ``docs/_build/html/`` directory.\n\n\nCredit\n------\n\nHong Minhee wrote this Python binding of LibSass_.\n\nHampton Catlin and Aaron Leung wrote LibSass_, which is portable C/C++\nimplementation of Sass_.\n\nHampton Catlin originally designed Sass_ language and wrote the first\nreference implementation of it in Ruby.\n\nThe above three are all distributed under `MIT license`_.\n\n.. _MIT license: https://mit-license.org/",
