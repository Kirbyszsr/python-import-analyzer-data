  "description": "=====================\n Javascript Minifier\n=====================\n\nrJSmin is a javascript minifier written in python.\n\nThe minifier is based on the semantics of `jsmin.c by Douglas Crockford`_\\.\n\nThe module is a re-implementation aiming for speed, so it can be used at\nruntime (rather than during a preprocessing step). Usually it produces the\nsame results as the original ``jsmin.c``. It differs in the following ways:\n\n- there is no error detection: unterminated string, regex and comment\n  literals are treated as regular javascript code and minified as such.\n- Control characters inside string and regex literals are left untouched; they\n  are not converted to spaces (nor to \\n)\n- Newline characters are not allowed inside string and regex literals, except\n  for line continuations in string literals (ECMA-5).\n- \"return /regex/\" is recognized correctly.\n- More characters are allowed before regexes.\n- Line terminators after regex literals are handled more sensibly\n- \"+ +\" and \"- -\" sequences are not collapsed to '++' or '--'\n- Newlines before ! operators are removed more sensibly\n- (Unnested) template literals are supported (ECMA-6)\n- Comments starting with an exclamation mark (``!``) can be kept optionally\n- rJSmin does not handle streams, but only complete strings. (However, the\n  module provides a \"streamy\" interface).\n\nSince most parts of the logic are handled by the regex engine it's way faster\nthan the original python port of ``jsmin.c`` by Baruch Even. The speed factor\nvaries between about 6 and 55 depending on input and python version (it gets\nfaster the more compressed the input already is).  Compared to the\nspeed-refactored python port by Dave St.Germain the performance gain is less\ndramatic but still between 3 and 50 (for huge inputs)). See the\ndocs/BENCHMARKS file for details.\n\nrjsmin.c is a reimplementation of rjsmin.py in C and speeds it up even more.\n\nSupported python versions are 2.7 and 3.4+.\n\n.. _jsmin.c by Douglas Crockford: http://www.crockford.com/javascript/jsmin.c\n\n\nCopyright and License\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nCopyright 2011 - 2019\nAndr\u00e9 Malo or his licensors, as applicable.\n\nThe whole package (except for the files in the bench/ directory) is\ndistributed under the Apache License Version 2.0.
