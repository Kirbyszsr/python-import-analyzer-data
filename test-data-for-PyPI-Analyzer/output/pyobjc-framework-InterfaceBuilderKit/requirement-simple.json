  "description": "\nWrappers for the framework \"InterfaceBuilderKit\" on macOS. This framework\nis only available when you've installed Xcode 3.x, but not with earlier or\nlater releases of Xcode.\n\nThe Interface Builder Kit is a framework containing the classes you use to\nimplement custom plug-ins for Interface Builder. A plug-in injects one or\nmore custom objects into Interface Builder's library window. From the library\nwindow, users can access your custom objects and drag them into their nib\nfiles just as they would the standard system controls. You can also use this\nframework to implement inspectors for manipulating your objects at runtime.\n\nThese wrappers don't include documentation, please check Apple's documention\nfor information on how to use this framework and PyObjC's documentation\nfor general tips and tricks regarding the translation between Python\nand (Objective-)C frameworks\n\nNOTE: To run the unittests for this framework use::\n\n    $ env DYLD_FRAMEWORK_PATH=\"$(xcode-select -print-path)/Library/PrivateFrameworks/\" python setup.py test  # noqa: B950\n\nThis is needed because the InterfaceBuilderKit framework won't load otherwise.\n\n\nProject links\n-------------\n\n* `Documentation <https://pyobjc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_\n\n* `Issue Tracker <https://github.com/ronaldoussoren/pyobjc/issues>`_\n\n* `Repository <https://github.com/ronaldoussoren/pyobjc/>`_\n\n\n\n",
