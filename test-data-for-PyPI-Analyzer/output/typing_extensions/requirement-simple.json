  "description": "Typing Extensions -- Backported and Experimental Type Hints for Python\n\nThe ``typing`` module was added to the standard library in Python 3.5, but\nmany new features have been added to the module since then.\nThis means users of Python 3.5 - 3.6 who are unable to upgrade will not be\nable to take advantage of new types added to the ``typing`` module, such as\n``typing.Protocol`` or ``typing.TypedDict``.\n\nThe ``typing_extensions`` module contains backports of these changes.\nExperimental types that will eventually be added to the ``typing``\nmodule are also included in ``typing_extensions``, such as\n``typing.ParamSpec`` and ``typing.TypeGuard``.\n\nUsers of Python versions before 3.5 should install and use\nthe ``typing`` module from PyPI instead of using this one, unless specifically\nwriting code that must be compatible with multiple Python versions or requires\nexperimental types.\n\n\n",
