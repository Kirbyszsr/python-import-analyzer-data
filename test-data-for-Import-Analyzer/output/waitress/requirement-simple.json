It has no dependencies except ones which live in the Python\nstandard library. It runs on CPython on Unix and Windows under Python 3.6+. It\nis also known to run on PyPy (version 3.6 compatible) on UNIX. It supports\nHTTP/1.0 and HTTP/1.1.\n\nFor more information, see the \"docs\" directory of the Waitress package or visit\nhttps://docs.pylonsproject.org/projects/waitress/en/latest/\n\n2.0.0 (2021-03-07)\n------------------\n\nFriendly Reminder\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nThis release still contains a variety of deprecation notices about defaults\nthat can be set for a variety of options.\n\nPlease note that this is your last warning, and you should update your\nconfiguration if you do NOT want to use the new defaults.\n\nSee the arguments documentation page for all supported options, and pay\nattention to the warnings:\n\nhttps://docs.pylonsproject.org/projects/waitress/en/stable/arguments.html\n\nWithout further ado, here's a short list of great changes thanks to our\ncontributors!\n\nBugfixes/Features\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n- Fix a crash on startup when listening to multiple interfaces.\n  See https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/pull/332\n\n- Waitress no longer attempts to guess at what the ``server_name`` should be for\n  a listen socket, instead it always use a new adjustment/argument named\n  ``server_name``.\n\n  Please see the documentation for ``server_name`` in\n  https://docs.pylonsproject.org/projects/waitress/en/latest/arguments.html and\n  see https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/pull/329\n\n- Allow tasks to notice if the client disconnected.\n\n  This inserts a callable ``waitress.client_disconnected`` into the environment\n  that allows the task to check if the client disconnected while waiting for\n  the response at strategic points in the execution and to cancel the\n  operation.\n\n  It requires setting the new adjustment ``channel_request_lookahead`` to a value\n  larger than 0, which continues to read requests from a channel even if a\n  request is already being processed on that channel, up to the given count,\n  since a client disconnect is detected by reading from a readable socket and\n  receiving an empty result.\n\n  See https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/pull/310\n\n- Drop Python 2.7 and 3.5 support\n\n- The server now issues warning output when it there are enough open\n  connections (controlled by \"connection_limit\"), that it is no longer\n  accepting new connections. This situation was previously difficult to\n  diagnose.\n  See https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/pull/322\n\n\n",
