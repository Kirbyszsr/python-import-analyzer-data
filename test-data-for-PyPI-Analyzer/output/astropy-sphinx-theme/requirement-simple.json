  "description": "Astropy Sphinx Theme(s)\n-----------------------\n\nThis is the repository for the default Astropy project documentation\ntheme(s). To use this theme, simply install this package then add the\nfollowing line to your documentation's ``conf.py`` file:\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    html_theme = 'bootstrap-astropy'\n\nThis requires Sphinx 1.6 or later to work properly. For older versions\nof Sphinx, you will need to do:\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    import astropy_sphinx_theme\n    html_theme_path = astropy_sphinx_theme.get_html_theme_path()\n    html_theme = 'bootstrap-astropy'\n\n``bootstrap-astropy`` is the only theme that is currently available, but\nthe structure of the package allows more themes to be added in future if\nneeded.\n\nSeveral options for the theme can be set in the ``conf.py`` file:\n\n.. code:: python\n\n  html_theme_options = {\n      'logotext1': 'packagename',  # white,  semi-bold\n      'logotext2': '',  # orange, light\n      'logotext3': ':docs',   # white,  light\n      'astropy_project_menubar': True\n      }\n\nThe ``logotext?`` options can be used to customize the top left logo, while\nthe ``astropy_project_menubar`` option can be set to ``True`` for packages\nthat are managed by the project itself (this will add links to find out more\nabout the Astropy project, about the team, and so on).\n\n.. image:: https://circleci.com/gh/astropy/astropy-sphinx-theme/tree/master.svg?style=svg\n    :target: https://circleci.com/gh/astropy/astropy-sphinx-theme/tree/master\n\n\n",
