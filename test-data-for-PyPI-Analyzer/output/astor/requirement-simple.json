[1]\n    The decompilation back to Python is based on code originally written\n    by Armin Ronacher.  Armin's code was well-structured, but failed on\n    some obscure corner cases of the Python language (and even more corner\n    cases when the AST changed on different versions of Python), and its\n    output arguably had cosmetic issues -- for example, it produced\n    parentheses even in some cases where they were not needed, to\n    avoid having to reason about precedence.\n\n    Other derivatives of Armin's code are floating around, and typically\n    have fixes for a few corner cases that happened to be noticed by the\n    maintainers, but most of them have not been tested as thoroughly as\n    astor.  One exception may be the version of codegen\n    `maintained at github by CensoredUsername`__.  This has been tested\n    to work properly on Python 2.7 using astor's test suite, and, as it\n    is a single source file, it may be easier to drop into some applications\n    that do not require astor's other features or Python 3.x compatibility.\n\n__ https://github.com/CensoredUsername/codegen\n\n\n",
