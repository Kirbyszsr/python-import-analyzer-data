It misses some SequenceMatcher's functionality, and has some\nextra OTOH.\n\nLevenshtein.c can be used as a pure C library, too.  You only have to define\nNO_PYTHON preprocessor symbol (-DNO_PYTHON) when compiling it.  The\nfunctionality is similar to that of the Python extension.  No separate docs\nare provided yet, RTFS.  But they are not interchangeable:\n\n* C functions exported when compiling with -DNO_PYTHON (see Levenshtein.h)\n  are not exported when compiling as a Python extension (and vice versa)\n\n* Unicode character type used with -DNO_PYTHON is wchar_t, Python extension\n  uses Py_UNICODE, they may be the same but don't count on it\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\n::\n\n   pip install python-Levenshtein\n\nDocumentation\n--------------\n\n* `Documentation for the current version <https://rawgit.com/ztane/python-Levenshtein/master/docs/Levenshtein.html>`_\n\ngendoc.sh generates HTML API documentation,\nyou probably want a selfcontained instead of includable version, so run\nin ``./gendoc.sh --selfcontained``.  It needs Levenshtein already installed\nand genextdoc.py.\n\nLicense\n-------\n\nLevenshtein is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it\nunder the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free\nSoftware Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or (at your option)\nany later version.\n\nSee the file COPYING for the full text of GNU General Public License version 2.\n\nHistory\n-------\n\nThis package was long missing from the Python Package Index and available as source checkout only, but can now `be found on PyPI again <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/python-Levenshtein>`_.\n\nWe needed to restore this package for `Go Mobile for Plone <http://webandmobile.mfabrik.com>`_\nand `Pywurfl <http://celljam.net/>`_ projects which depend on this.\n\nSource code\n-----------\n\n* http://github.com/ztane/python-Levenshtein/\n\nAuthors\n-------\n\n* Maintainer: `Antti Haapala <antti@haapala.name>`\n\n* Python 3 compatibility: Esa M\u00e4\u00e4tt\u00e4\n\n* Jonatas CD: Fixed documentation generation\n\n* Previous maintainer: `Mikko Ohtamaa <http://opensourcehacker.com>`_\n\n* Original code: David Necas (Yeti) <yeti at physics.muni.cz>\n\n============\n Changelog\n============\n\n0.12.1\n------\n\n* Fixed handling of numerous possible wraparounds in calculating the size\n  of memory allocations; incorrect handling of which could cause denial\n  of service or even possible remote code execution in previous versions\n  of the library.\n\n0.12.0\n------\n\n* Fixed a bug in StringMatcher.StringMatcher.get_matching_blocks /\n  extract_editops for Python 3; now allow only `str` editops on\n  both Python 2 and Python 3, for simpler and working code.\n\n* Added documentation in the source distribution and in GIT\n\n* Fixed the package layout: renamed the .so/.dll to _levenshtein,\n  and made it reside inside a package, along with the StringMatcher\n  class.\n\n* Fixed spelling errors.\n\n0.11.2\n------\n\n* Fixed a bug in setup.py: installation would fail on Python 3 if the locale\n  did not specify UTF-8 charset (Felix Yan).\n\n* Added COPYING, StringMatcher.py, gendoc.sh and NEWS in MANIFEST.in, as they\n  were missing from source distributions.\n\n0.11.1\n------\n\n* Added Levenshtein.h to MANIFEST.in\n\n0.11.0\n------\n\n* Python 3 support, maintainership passed to Antti Haapala\n\n0.10.1 - 0.10.2\n---------------\n\n* Made python-Lehvenstein Git compatible and use setuptools for PyPi upload\n\n* Created HISTORY.txt and made README reST compatible",
