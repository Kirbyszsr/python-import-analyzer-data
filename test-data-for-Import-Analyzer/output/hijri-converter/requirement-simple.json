Issue `#3 <https://github.com/dralshehri/hijri-converter/issues/3>`__ by `@PureTryOut <https://github.com/PureTryOut>`__.\n- Fixed some typos.\n- Updated tests.\n\n**2.1.0**\n\nThis version has more accurate conversion and better internal code.\nDetails are as follows:\n\n- Dropped support for the years before 1343 AH because the Umm al-Qura calendar\n  was not established then.\n- Added ``validate`` parameter to Hijri object for optional disabling of\n  Hijri date validation and improving performance.\n- Verified conversion against original references and updated the\n  ``month_starts`` tuple for more accurate conversion.\n- Improved ``Hijri`` object rich comparison methods.\n- Improved date validation methods for better performance and readability.\n- Made the ``Hijri`` object hashable by adding a custom ``__hash__`` method.\n- Refactored many internal methods (not affecting the API).\n- Other minor fixes, enhancements and performance boost.\n\n**2.0.0**\n\nIn short, this version supports only lunar Hijri calendar on Python 3.6+, and\nthe conversion is in complete agreement with the official Umm al-Qura calendar.\nDetails are as follows:\n\n- Renamed the package to ``hijri-converter``.\n- Dropped support for the solar Hijri calendar.\n- Dropped support for Python 3.5.\n- Refactored localization and ``ummalqura.py`` module.\n- Updated ``month_starts`` tuple in alignment with the Umm al-Qura calendar.\n- Added ``fromdate()`` classmethod to ``Gregorian`` object.\n- Added ``notation()`` method to ``Hijri`` and ``Gregorian`` objects.\n- Added more methods to ``Gregorian`` object including ``slashformat()``,\n  ``month_name()``, ``day_name()`` and ``to_julian()``.\n- Renamed ``month_days()`` method of ``Hijri`` object to ``month_length()``.\n- Changed formatted string to use f-strings.\n- Improved documentation and examples.\n- Updated unit tests.\n- Fixed other minor issues and typos.\n\n**1.5.0**\n\n- Added ``fromisoformat()`` classmethod to ``Hijri`` object.\n- Added support for rich comparison between Hijri dates.\n- Updated documentation and testing code.\n- Other minor fixes and enhancements.\n\n**1.4.0**\n\n- Refactored conversion methods to improve performance.\n- Changed date validation back to be the default and removed optional parameter.\n- Added ``to_julian()`` method to ``Hijri`` object.\n- Updated documentation and testing code.\n- Other minor fixes and enhancements.\n\n**1.3.3**\n\n- Fixed a bug in range validation for the Gregorian date.\n- Changed generic typing to built-in types.\n- Added more tests to cover the solar calendar.\n- Improved code structure and documentation.\n\n**1.3.2**\n\n- Improved documentation and changelog.\n\n**1.3.1**\n\n- Fixed README file.\n\n**1.3.0**\n\n- Added documentation directory with an online version.\n- Changed date input validation to be optional and disabled by default.\n- Improved code readability and performance.\n- Other minor fixes and enhancements.\n\n**1.2.0**\n\n- Added ``slashformat()`` method to ``Hijri`` object.\n- Improved date validation code.\n- Fixed some typos in documentation and docstrings.\n\n**1.0.1**\n\n- Improved examples and documentation.\n\n**1.0.0**\n\n- First release.\n\n\n",
