  "description": "PyCryptodome\n============\n\nPyCryptodome is a self-contained Python package of low-level\ncryptographic primitives.\n\nIt supports Python 2.7, Python 3.5 and newer, and PyPy.\n\nYou can install it with::\n\n    pip install pycryptodome\n\nAll modules are installed under the ``Crypto`` package.\n\nCheck the pycryptodomex_ project for the equivalent library that\nworks under the ``Cryptodome`` package.\n\nPyCryptodome is a fork of PyCrypto. It brings several enhancements\nwith respect to the last official version of PyCrypto (2.6.1),\nfor instance:\n\n* Authenticated encryption modes (GCM, CCM, EAX, SIV, OCB)\n* Accelerated AES on Intel platforms via AES-NI\n* First class support for PyPy\n* Elliptic curves cryptography (NIST P-256, P-384 and P-521 curves only)\n* Better and more compact API (`nonce` and `iv` attributes for ciphers,\n  automatic generation of random nonces and IVs, simplified CTR cipher mode,\n  and more)\n* SHA-3 (including SHAKE XOFs) and BLAKE2 hash algorithms\n* Salsa20 and ChaCha20 stream ciphers\n* scrypt and HKDF\n* Deterministic (EC)DSA\n* Password-protected PKCS#8 key containers\n* Shamir's Secret Sharing scheme\n* Random numbers get sourced directly from the OS (and not from a CSPRNG in userspace)\n* Simplified install process, including better support for Windows\n* Cleaner RSA and DSA key generation (largely based on FIPS 186-4)\n* Major clean ups and simplification of the code base\n\nPyCryptodome is not a wrapper to a separate C library like *OpenSSL*.\nTo the largest possible extent, algorithms are implemented in pure Python.\nOnly the pieces that are extremely critical to performance (e.g. block ciphers)\nare implemented as C extensions.\n\nFor more information, see the `homepage`_.\n\nAll the code can be downloaded from `GitHub`_.\n\n.. _pycryptodomex: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pycryptodomex\n.. _`homepage`: http://www.pycryptodome.org\n.. _GitHub: https://github.com/Legrandin/pycryptodome\n\n\n",
