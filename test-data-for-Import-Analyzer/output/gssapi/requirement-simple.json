While it focuses on the Kerberos mechanism, it should also be\nuseable with other GSSAPI mechanisms.\n\nDocumentation for the latest released version (including pre-release versions)\ncan be found at\n`https://pythongssapi.github.io/python-gssapi/stable <https://pythongssapi.github.io/python-gssapi/stable>`_.\n\nDocumentation for the latest commit on main can be found at\n`https://pythongssapi.github.io/python-gssapi/latest <https://pythongssapi.github.io/python-gssapi/latest>`_.\n\nRequirements\n============\n\nBasic\n-----\n\n* A working implementation of GSSAPI (such as from MIT Kerberos)\n  which supports delegation and includes header files\n\n* a C compiler (such as GCC)\n\n* Python 3.6+ (older releases support older versions, but are unsupported)\n\n* the `decorator` python package\n\nCompiling from Scratch\n----------------------\n\nTo compile from scratch, you will need Cython >= 0.21.1.\n\nFor Running the Tests\n---------------------\n\n* the `nose` package\n\n* the `k5test` package\n\nTo install test dependencies using pip:\n\n::\n\n    $ pip install -r test-requirements.txt # Optional, for running test suite\n\nInstallation\n============\n\nEasy Way\n--------\n\n::\n\n    $ pip install gssapi\n\nFrom the Git Repo\n-----------------\n\nAfter being sure to install all the requirements,\n\n::\n\n    $ git clone https://github.com/pythongssapi/python-gssapi.git\n    $ python setup.py build\n    $ python setup.py install\n\nTests\n=====\n\nThe tests for for Python-GSSAPI live in `gssapi.tests`.  In order to\nrun the tests, you must have an MIT Kerberos installation (including\nthe KDC).  The tests create a self-contained Kerberos setup, so running\nthe tests will not interfere with any existing Kerberos installations.\n\nStructure\n=========\n\nPython-GSSAPI is composed of two parts: a low-level C-style API which\nthinly wraps the underlying RFC 2744 methods, and a high-level, Pythonic\nAPI (which is itself a wrapper around the low-level API).  Examples may\nbe found in the `examples` directory.\n\nLow-Level API\n-------------\n\nThe low-level API lives in `gssapi.raw`.  The methods contained therein\nare designed to match closely with the original GSSAPI C methods.  All\nrelevant methods and classes may be imported directly from `gssapi.raw`.\nExtension methods will only be imported if they are present.  The low-level\nAPI follows the given format:\n\n* Names match the RFC 2744 specification, with the `gssapi_`\n  prefix removed\n\n* Parameters which use C int constants as enums have\n  `enum.IntEnum` classes defined, and thus may be passed\n  either the enum members or integers\n\n* In cases where a specific constant is passed in the C API to represent\n  a default value, `None` should be passed instead\n\n* In cases where non-integer constants would be used in the API (i.e.\n  OIDs), enum-like objects have been defined containing named references\n  to values specified in RFC 2744.\n\n* Major and minor error codes are returned by raising\n  `gssapi.raw.GSSError`.  The major error codes have exceptions\n  defined in in `gssapi.raw.exceptions` to make it easier to catch specific\n  errors or categories of errors.\n\n* All other relevant output values are returned via named tuples.\n\nHigh-Level API\n--------------\n\nThe high-level API lives directly under `gssapi`.  The classes\ncontained in each file are designed to provide a more Pythonic, Object-Oriented\nview of GSSAPI.  The exceptions from the low-level API, plus several additional\nexceptions, live in `gssapi.exceptions`.  The rest of the classes may be\nimported directly from `gssapi`.  Only classes are exported by `gssapi` --\nall functions are methods of classes in the high-level API.\n\nPlease note that QoP is not supported in the high-level API, since it has been\ndeprecated.\n\nExtensions\n----------\n\nIn addition to RFC 2743/2744, Python-GSSAPI also has support for:\n\n* RFC 5587 (Extended GSS Mechanism Inquiry APIs)\n\n* RFC 5588 (GSS-API Extension for Storing Delegated Credentials)\n\n* (Additional) Credential Store Extension\n\n* Services4User\n\n* Credentials import-export\n\n* RFC 6680 (GSS-API Naming Extensions)\n\n* DCE and IOV MIC extensions\n\n* `acquire_cred_with_password` and `add_cred_with_password`\n\n* GGF Extensions\n\nThe Team\n========\n\n(GitHub usernames in parentheses)\n\n* Robbie Harwood (@frozencemetery) - current maintainer and developer\n* Simo Sorce (@simo5) - developer\n* Solly Ross (@directxman12) - author emeritus\n* Hugh Cole-Baker (@sigmaris) - author emeritus\n\nGet Involved\n============\n\nWe welcome new contributions in the form of Issues and Pull Requests on\nGithub.
