  "description": "\nSince [`pip`](https://pypi.org/p/pip) is a command-line-tool, [it does not have\nan official, supported, _importable_\nAPI](https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/user_guide/#using-pip-from-your-program).\n\nHowever, this does not mean that people haven't tried to `import pip`, usually\nto end up with much headache when `pip`'s maintainers do routine refactoring.\n\nThis project attempts to provide an importable `pip` API, which is _fully\ncompliant_ with the recommended method of using `pip` from your program.\n\n## Supported Commands\n\nNot all commands are supported in all versions of `pip` and on all platforms.\nIf the command you are trying to use is not compatible, `pip_api` will raise a\n`pip_api.exceptions.Incompatible` exception for your program to catch.\n\n### Available with all `pip` versions:\n* `pip_api.version()`\n  > Returns the `pip` version as a string, e.g. `\"9.0.1\"`\n\n* `pip_api.installed_distributions()`\n  > Returns a list of all installed distributions as a `Distribution` object with the following attributes:\n  > * `Distribution.name` (`string`): The name of the installed distribution\n  > * `Distribution.version` ([`packaging.version.Version`](https://packaging.pypa.io/en/latest/version/#packaging.version.Version)): The version of the installed distribution\n  > * `Distribution.location` (`string`): The location of the installed distribution\n  > * `Distribution.editable` (`bool`): Whether the distribution is editable or not\n\n* `pip_api.parse_requirements(filename, options=None, include_invalid=False)`\n  > Takes a path to a filename of a Requirements file. Returns a mapping from package name to a [`packaging.requirements.Requirement`](https://packaging.pypa.io/en/latest/requirements/#packaging.requirements.Requirement) object with the following attributes:\n  > * `Requirement.name` (`string`): The name of the requirement.\n  > * `Requirement.extras` (`set`): A set of extras that the requirement specifies.\n  > * `Requirement.specifier` ([`packaging.specifiers.SpecifierSet`](https://packaging.pypa.io/en/latest/specifiers/#packaging.specifiers.SpecifierSet)): A `SpecifierSet` of the version specified by the requirement.\n  > * `Requirement.marker` ([`packaging.markers.Marker`](https://packaging.pypa.io/en/latest/markers/#packaging.markers.Marker)): A `Marker` of the marker for the requirement. Can be None.`\n  > Optionally takes an `options` parameter to override the regex used to skip requirements lines.\n  > Optionally takes an `include_invalid` parameter to return an `UnparsedRequirement` in the event that a requirement cannot be parsed correctly.\n\n### Available with `pip>=8.0.0`:\n* `pip_api.hash(filename, algorithm='sha256')`\n  > Returns the resulting as a string.\n  > Valid `algorithm` parameters are `'sha256'`, `'sha384'`, and `'sha512'`\n\n\n",
