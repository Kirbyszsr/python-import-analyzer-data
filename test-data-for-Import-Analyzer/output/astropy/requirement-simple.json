This repository contains the core package which is\nintended to contain much of the core functionality and some common tools needed\nfor performing astronomy and astrophysics with Python.\n\nReleases are `registered on PyPI <https://pypi.org/project/astropy>`_,\nand development is occurring at the\n`project's GitHub page <http://github.com/astropy/astropy>`_.\n\nFor installation instructions, see the `online documentation <https://docs.astropy.org/>`_\nor  `docs/install.rst <docs/install.rst>`_ in this source distribution.\n\nContributing Code, Documentation, or Feedback\n---------------------------------------------\n\nThe Astropy Project is made both by and for its users, so we welcome and\nencourage contributions of many kinds. Our goal is to keep this a positive,\ninclusive, successful, and growing community by abiding with the\n`Astropy Community Code of Conduct <http://www.astropy.org/about.html#codeofconduct>`_.\n\nMore detailed information on contributing to the project or submitting feedback\ncan be found on the `contributions <http://www.astropy.org/contribute.html>`_\npage. A `summary of contribution guidelines <CONTRIBUTING.md>`_ can also be\nused as a quick reference when you are ready to start writing or validating\ncode for submission.\n\nSupporting the Project\n----------------------\n\n|NumFOCUS| |Donate|\n\nThe Astropy Project is sponsored by NumFOCUS, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit in the\nUnited States. You can donate to the project by using the link above, and this\ndonation will support our mission to promote sustainable, high-level code base\nfor the astronomy community, open code development, educational materials, and\nreproducible scientific research.\n\nLicense\n-------\n\nAstropy is licensed under a 3-clause BSD style license - see the\n`LICENSE.rst <LICENSE.rst>`_ file.\n\n.. |Actions Status| image:: https://github.com/astropy/astropy/workflows/CI/badge.svg\n    :target: https://github.com/astropy/astropy/actions\n    :alt: Astropy's GitHub Actions CI Status\n\n.. |CircleCI Status| image::  https://img.shields.io/circleci/build/github/astropy/astropy/master?logo=circleci&label=CircleCI\n    :target: https://circleci.com/gh/astropy/astropy\n    :alt: Astropy's CircleCI Status\n\n.. |Coverage Status| image:: https://codecov.io/gh/astropy/astropy/branch/master/graph/badge.svg\n    :target: https://codecov.io/gh/astropy/astropy\n    :alt: Astropy's Coverage Status\n\n.. |PyPI Status| image:: https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/astropy.svg\n    :target: https://pypi.org/project/astropy\n    :alt: Astropy's PyPI Status\n\n.. |Documentation Status| image:: https://img.shields.io/readthedocs/astropy/latest.svg?logo=read%20the%20docs&logoColor=white&label=Docs&version=stable\n    :target: https://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/?badge=stable\n    :alt: Documentation Status\n\n.. |NumFOCUS| image:: https://img.shields.io/badge/powered%20by-NumFOCUS-orange.svg?style=flat&colorA=E1523D&colorB=007D8A\n    :target: http://numfocus.org\n    :alt: Powered by NumFOCUS\n\n.. |Donate| image:: https://img.shields.io/badge/Donate-to%20Astropy-brightgreen.svg\n    :target: https://numfocus.salsalabs.org/donate-to-astropy/index.html\n\n\n",
