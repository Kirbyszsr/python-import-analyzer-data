  "description": "Internationalized Domain Names in Applications (IDNA)\n=====================================================\n\nSupport for the Internationalised Domain Names in Applications\n(IDNA) protocol as specified in `RFC 5891 <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5891>`_.\nThis is the latest version of the protocol and is sometimes referred to as\n\u201cIDNA 2008\u201d.\n\nThis library also provides support for Unicode Technical Standard 46,\n`Unicode IDNA Compatibility Processing <https://unicode.org/reports/tr46/>`_.\n\nThis acts as a suitable replacement for the \u201cencodings.idna\u201d module that\ncomes with the Python standard library, but which only supports the\nold, deprecated IDNA specification (`RFC 3490 <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3490>`_).\n\nBasic functions are simply executed:\n\n.. code-block:: pycon\n\n    >>> import idna\n    >>> idna.encode('\u30c9\u30e1\u30a4\u30f3.\u30c6\u30b9\u30c8')\n    b'xn--eckwd4c7c.xn--zckzah'\n    >>> print(idna.decode('xn--eckwd4c7c.xn--zckzah'))\n    \u30c9\u30e1\u30a4\u30f3.\u30c6\u30b9\u30c8\n\nPackages\n--------\n\nThe latest tagged release version is published in the PyPI repository:\n\n.. image:: https://badge.fury.io/py/idna.svg\n   :target: https://badge.fury.io/py/idna\n\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nTo install this library, you can use pip:\n\n.. code-block:: bash\n\n    $ pip install idna\n\nAlternatively, you can install the package using the bundled setup script:\n\n.. code-block:: bash\n\n    $ python setup.py install\n\nThis library works with Python 3.4 or later. Earlier versions of this\nlibrary support Python 2 - use \"idna<3\" in your requirements file if\nyou need this library for a Python 2 application.\n\n\nUsage\n-----\n\nFor typical usage, the ``encode`` and ``decode`` functions will take a domain\nname argument and perform a conversion to A-labels or U-labels respectively.\n\n.. code-block:: pycon\n\n    >>> import idna\n    >>> idna.encode('\u30c9\u30e1\u30a4\u30f3.\u30c6\u30b9\u30c8')\n    b'xn--eckwd4c7c.xn--zckzah'\n    >>> print(idna.decode('xn--eckwd4c7c.xn--zckzah'))\n    \u30c9\u30e1\u30a4\u30f3.\u30c6\u30b9\u30c8\n\nYou may use the codec encoding and decoding methods using the\n``idna.codec`` module:\n\n.. code-block:: pycon\n\n    >>> import idna.codec\n    >>> print('\u0434\u043e\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0430.\u0438\u0441\u043f\u044b\u0442\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435'.encode('idna'))\n    b'xn--80ahd1agd.xn--80akhbyknj4f'\n    >>> print(b'xn--80ahd1agd.xn--80akhbyknj4f'.decode('idna'))\n    \u0434\u043e\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0430.\u0438\u0441\u043f\u044b\u0442\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435\n\nConversions can be applied at a per-label basis using the ``ulabel`` or ``alabel``\nfunctions if necessary:\n\n.. code-block:: pycon\n\n    >>> idna.alabel('\u6d4b\u8bd5')\n    b'xn--0zwm56d'\n\nCompatibility Mapping (UTS #46)\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\nAs described in `RFC 5895 <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5895>`_, the IDNA\nspecification does not normalize input from different potential ways a user\nmay input a domain name. This functionality, known as a \u201cmapping\u201d, is \nconsidered by the specification to be a local user-interface issue distinct\nfrom IDNA conversion functionality.\n\nThis library provides one such mapping, that was developed by the Unicode\nConsortium. Known as `Unicode IDNA Compatibility Processing <https://unicode.org/reports/tr46/>`_,\nit provides for both a regular mapping for typical applications, as well as\na transitional mapping to help migrate from older IDNA 2003 applications.\n\nFor example, \u201cK\u00f6nigsg\u00e4\u00dfchen\u201d is not a permissible label as *LATIN CAPITAL\nLETTER K* is not allowed (nor are capital letters in general). UTS 46 will\nconvert this into lower case prior to applying the IDNA conversion.\n\n.. code-block:: pycon\n\n    >>> import idna\n    >>> idna.encode('K\u00f6nigsg\u00e4\u00dfchen')\n    ...\n    idna.core.InvalidCodepoint: Codepoint U+004B at position 1 of 'K\u00f6nigsg\u00e4\u00dfchen' not allowed\n    >>> idna.encode('K\u00f6nigsg\u00e4\u00dfchen', uts46=True)\n    b'xn--knigsgchen-b4a3dun'\n    >>> print(idna.decode('xn--knigsgchen-b4a3dun'))\n    k\u00f6nigsg\u00e4\u00dfchen\n\nTransitional processing provides conversions to help transition from the older\n2003 standard to the current standard. For example, in the original IDNA\nspecification, the *LATIN SMALL LETTER SHARP S* (\u00df) was converted into two\n*LATIN SMALL LETTER S* (ss), whereas in the current IDNA specification this\nconversion is not performed.\n\n.. code-block:: pycon\n\n    >>> idna.encode('K\u00f6nigsg\u00e4\u00dfchen', uts46=True, transitional=True)\n    'xn--knigsgsschen-lcb0w'\n\nImplementors should use transitional processing with caution, only in rare\ncases where conversion from legacy labels to current labels must be performed\n(i.e. IDNA implementations that pre-date 2008). For typical applications\nthat just need to convert labels, transitional processing is unlikely to be\nbeneficial and could produce unexpected incompatible results.\n\n``encodings.idna`` Compatibility\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\nFunction calls from the Python built-in ``encodings.idna`` module are\nmapped to their IDNA 2008 equivalents using the ``idna.compat`` module.\nSimply substitute the ``import`` clause in your code to refer to the\nnew module name.\n\nExceptions\n----------\n\nAll errors raised during the conversion following the specification should\nraise an exception derived from the ``idna.IDNAError`` base class.\n\nMore specific exceptions that may be generated as ``idna.IDNABidiError``\nwhen the error reflects an illegal combination of left-to-right and\nright-to-left characters in a label; ``idna.InvalidCodepoint`` when\na specific codepoint is an illegal character in an IDN label (i.e.\nINVALID); and ``idna.InvalidCodepointContext`` when the codepoint is\nillegal based on its positional context (i.e. it is CONTEXTO or CONTEXTJ\nbut the contextual requirements are not satisfied.)\n\nBuilding and Diagnostics\n------------------------\n\nThe IDNA and UTS 46 functionality relies upon pre-calculated lookup\ntables for performance. These tables are derived from computing against\neligibility criteria in the respective standards. These tables are\ncomputed using the command-line script ``tools/idna-data``.\n\nThis tool will fetch relevant codepoint data from the Unicode repository \nand perform the required calculations to identify eligibility. There are \nthree main modes:\n\n* ``idna-data make-libdata``. Generates ``idnadata.py`` and ``uts46data.py``,\n  the pre-calculated lookup tables using for IDNA and UTS 46 conversions. Implementors\n  who wish to track this library against a different Unicode version may use this tool\n  to manually generate a different version of the ``idnadata.py`` and ``uts46data.py``\n  files.\n\n* ``idna-data make-table``. Generate a table of the IDNA disposition\n  (e.g. PVALID, CONTEXTJ, CONTEXTO) in the format found in Appendix B.1 of RFC\n  5892 and the pre-computed tables published by `IANA <https://www.iana.org/>`_.\n\n* ``idna-data U+0061``. Prints debugging output on the various properties\n  associated with an individual Unicode codepoint (in this case, U+0061), that are\n  used to assess the IDNA and UTS 46 status of a codepoint. This is helpful in debugging\n  or analysis.\n\nThe tool accepts a number of arguments, described using ``idna-data -h``. Most notably,\nthe ``--version`` argument allows the specification of the version of Unicode to use\nin computing the table data. For example, ``idna-data --version 9.0.0 make-libdata``\nwill generate library data against Unicode 9.0.0.\n\n\nTesting\n-------\n\nThe library has a test suite based on each rule of the IDNA specification, as\nwell as tests that are provided as part of the Unicode Technical Standard 46,\n`Unicode IDNA Compatibility Processing <https://unicode.org/reports/tr46/>`_.\n\n\n",
