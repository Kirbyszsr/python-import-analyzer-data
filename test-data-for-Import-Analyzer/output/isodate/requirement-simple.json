If something is not\nmentioned there, then it is treated as non existent, and not as an allowed\noption.\n\nFor instance, ISO8601:2004 never mentions 2 digit years. So, it is not\nintended by this module to support 2 digit years. (while it may still\nbe valid as ISO date, because it is not explicitly forbidden.)\nAnother example is, when no time zone information is given for a time,\nthen it should be interpreted as local time, and not UTC.\n\nAs this module maps ISO 8601 dates/times to standard Python data types, like\n*date*, *time*, *datetime* and *timedelta*, it is not possible to convert\nall possible ISO 8601 dates/times. For instance, dates before 0001-01-01 are\nnot allowed by the Python *date* and *datetime* classes. Additionally\nfractional seconds are limited to microseconds. That means if the parser finds\nfor instance nanoseconds it will round it to microseconds.\n\nDocumentation\n-------------\n\nCurrently there are four parsing methods available.\n   * parse_time:\n        parses an ISO 8601 time string into a *time* object\n   * parse_date:\n        parses an ISO 8601 date string into a *date* object\n   * parse_datetime:\n        parses an ISO 8601 date-time string into a *datetime* object\n   * parse_duration:\n        parses an ISO 8601 duration string into a *timedelta* or *Duration*\n        object.\n   * parse_tzinfo:\n        parses the time zone info part of an ISO 8601 string into a\n        *tzinfo* object.\n\nAs ISO 8601 allows to define durations in years and months, and *timedelta*\ndoes not handle years and months, this module provides a *Duration* class,\nwhich can be used almost like a *timedelta* object (with some limitations).\nHowever, a *Duration* object can be converted into a *timedelta* object.\n\nThere are also ISO formatting methods for all supported data types. Each\n*xxx_isoformat* method accepts a format parameter. The default format is\nalways the ISO 8601 expanded format. This is the same format used by\n*datetime.isoformat*:\n\n    * time_isoformat:\n        Intended to create ISO time strings with default format\n        *hh:mm:ssZ*.\n    * date_isoformat:\n        Intended to create ISO date strings with default format\n        *yyyy-mm-dd*.\n    * datetime_isoformat:\n        Intended to create ISO date-time strings with default format\n        *yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm:ssZ*.\n    * duration_isoformat:\n        Intended to create ISO duration strings with default format\n        *PnnYnnMnnDTnnHnnMnnS*.\n    * tz_isoformat:\n        Intended to create ISO time zone strings with default format\n        *hh:mm*.\n    * strftime:\n        A re-implementation mostly compatible with Python's *strftime*, but\n        supports only those format strings, which can also be used for dates\n        prior 1900. This method also understands how to format *datetime* and\n        *Duration* instances.\n\nInstallation:\n-------------\n\nThis module can easily be installed with Python standard installation methods.\n\nEither use *python setup.py install* or in case you have *setuptools* or\n*distribute* available, you can also use *easy_install*.\n\nLimitations:\n------------\n\n   * The parser accepts several date/time representation which should be invalid\n     according to ISO 8601 standard.\n\n     1. for date and time together, this parser accepts a mixture of basic and extended format.\n        e.g. the date could be in basic format, while the time is accepted in extended format.\n        It also allows short dates and times in date-time strings.\n     2. For incomplete dates, the first day is chosen. e.g. 19th century results in a date of\n        1901-01-01.\n     3. negative *Duration* and *timedelta* value are not fully supported yet.\n\nFurther information:\n--------------------\n\nThe doc strings and unit tests should provide rather detailed information about\nthe methods and their limitations.\n\nThe source release provides a *setup.py* script,\nwhich can be used to run the unit tests included.\n\nSource code is available at `<http://github.com/gweis/isodate>`_.\n\nCHANGES\n=======\n\n0.6.0 (2017-10-13)\n------------------\n\n- support incomplete month date (Fabien Loffredo)\n- rely on duck typing when doing duration maths\n- support ':' as separator in fractional time zones (usrenmae)\n\n\n0.5.4 (2015-08-06)\n------------------\n\n- Fix parsing of Periods (Fabien Bochu)\n- Make Duration objects hashable (Geoffrey Fairchild)\n- Add multiplication to duration (Reinoud Elhorst)\n\n\n0.5.1 (2014-11-07)\n------------------\n\n- fixed pickling of Duration objects\n- raise ISO8601Error when there is no 'T' separator in datetime strings (Adrian Coveney)\n\n\n0.5.0 (2014-02-23)\n------------------\n\n- ISO8601Error are subclasses of ValueError now (Michael Hrivnak)\n- improve compatibility across various python variants and versions\n- raise exceptions when using fractional years and months in date\n  maths with durations\n- renamed method todatetime on Duraction objects to totimedelta\n\n\n0.4.9 (2012-10-30)\n------------------\n\n- support pickling FixedOffset instances\n- make sure parsed fractional seconds are in microseconds\n- add leading zeros when formattig microseconds (Jarom Loveridge)\n\n\n0.4.8 (2012-05-04)\n------------------\n\n- fixed incompatibility of unittests with python 2.5 and 2.6 (runs fine on 2.7\n  and 3.2)\n\n\n0.4.7 (2012-01-26)\n------------------\n\n- fixed tzinfo formatting (never pass None into tzinfo.utcoffset())\n\n\n0.4.6 (2012-01-06)\n------------------\n\n- added Python 3 compatibility via 2to3\n\n0.4.5 (2012-01-06)\n------------------\n\n- made setuptools dependency optional\n\n0.4.4 (2011-04-16)\n------------------\n\n- Fixed formatting of microseconds for datetime objects\n\n0.4.3 (2010-10-29)\n------------------\n\n- Fixed problem with %P formating and fractions (supplied by David Brooks)\n\n0.4.2 (2010-10-28)\n------------------\n\n- Implemented unary - for Duration (supplied by David Brooks)\n- Output fractional seconds with '%P' format.

(`<http://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-2/#duration-order>`_)\n       - refactor to have duration mathematics only at one place.\n       - localize __str__ method (does timedelta do this?)\n       - when is a Duration negative?\n       - normalize Durations. months [00-12] and years ]-inf,+inf[\n",
