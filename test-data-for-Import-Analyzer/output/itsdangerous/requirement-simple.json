  "description": "ItsDangerous\n============\n\n... so better sign this\n\nVarious helpers to pass data to untrusted environments and to get it\nback safe and sound. Data is cryptographically signed to ensure that a\ntoken has not been tampered with.\n\nIt's possible to customize how data is serialized. Data is compressed as\nneeded. A timestamp can be added and verified automatically while\nloading a token.\n\n\nInstalling\n----------\n\nInstall and update using `pip`_:\n\n.. code-block:: text\n\n    pip install -U itsdangerous\n\n.. _pip: https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/quickstart/\n\n\nA Simple Example\n----------------\n\nHere's how you could generate a token for transmitting a user's id and\nname between web requests.\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    from itsdangerous import URLSafeSerializer\n    auth_s = URLSafeSerializer(\"secret key\", \"auth\")\n    token = auth_s.dumps({\"id\": 5, \"name\": \"itsdangerous\"})\n\n    print(token)\n    # eyJpZCI6NSwibmFtZSI6Iml0c2Rhbmdlcm91cyJ9.6YP6T0BaO67XP--9UzTrmurXSmg\n\n    data = auth_s.loads(token)\n    print(data[\"name\"])\n    # itsdangerous\n\n\nDonate\n------\n\nThe Pallets organization develops and supports ItsDangerous and other\npopular packages.
