  "description": "The `old pathlib <https://bitbucket.org/pitrou/pathlib>`_\nmodule on bitbucket is in bugfix-only mode.\nThe goal of pathlib2 is to provide a backport of\n`standard pathlib <http://docs.python.org/dev/library/pathlib.html>`_\nmodule which tracks the standard library module,\nso all the newest features of the standard pathlib can be\nused also on older Python versions.\n\nDownload\n--------\n\nStandalone releases are available on PyPI:\nhttp://pypi.python.org/pypi/pathlib2/\n\nDevelopment\n-----------\n\nThe main development takes place in the Python standard library: see\nthe `Python developer's guide <http://docs.python.org/devguide/>`_.\nIn particular, new features should be submitted to the\n`Python bug tracker <http://bugs.python.org/>`_.\n\nIssues that occur in this backport, but that do not occur not in the\nstandard Python pathlib module can be submitted on\nthe `pathlib2 bug tracker <https://github.com/mcmtroffaes/pathlib2/issues>`_.\n\nDocumentation\n-------------\n\nRefer to the\n`standard pathlib <http://docs.python.org/dev/library/pathlib.html>`_\ndocumentation.\n\nKnown Issues\n------------\n\nFor historic reasons, pathlib2 still uses bytes to represent file paths internally.\nUnfortunately, on Windows with Python 2.7, the file system encoder (``mcbs``)\nhas only poor support for non-ascii characters,\nand can silently replace non-ascii characters without warning.\nFor example, ``u'\u0442\u0435\u0441\u0442'.encode(sys.getfilesystemencoding())`` results in ``????``\nwhich is obviously completely useless.\n\nTherefore, on Windows with Python 2.7, until this problem is fixed upstream,\nunfortunately you cannot rely on pathlib2 to support the full unicode range for filenames.\nSee `issue #56 <https://github.com/mcmtroffaes/pathlib2/issues/56>`_ for more details.\n\n.. |travis| image:: https://travis-ci.org/mcmtroffaes/pathlib2.png?branch=develop\n    :target: https://travis-ci.org/mcmtroffaes/pathlib2\n    :alt: travis-ci\n\n.. |appveyor| image:: https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/baddx3rpet2wyi2c?svg=true\n    :target: https://ci.appveyor.com/project/mcmtroffaes/pathlib2\n    :alt: appveyor\n\n.. |codecov| image:: https://codecov.io/gh/mcmtroffaes/pathlib2/branch/develop/graph/badge.svg\n    :target: https://codecov.io/gh/mcmtroffaes/pathlib2\n    :alt: codecov\n\n\n\n",
