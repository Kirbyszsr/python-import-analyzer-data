  "description": "The Requests Toolbelt\n=====================\n\nThis is just a collection of utilities for `python-requests`_, but don't \nreally belong in ``requests`` proper. The minimum tested requests version is \n``2.1.0``. In reality, the toolbelt should work with ``2.0.1`` as well, but \nsome idiosyncracies prevent effective or sane testing on that version.\n\n``pip install requests-toolbelt`` to get started!\n\n\nmultipart/form-data Encoder\n---------------------------\n\nThe main attraction is a streaming multipart form-data object, ``MultipartEncoder``.\nIts API looks like this:\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    from requests_toolbelt import MultipartEncoder\n    import requests\n\n    m = MultipartEncoder(\n        fields={'field0': 'value', 'field1': 'value',\n                'field2': ('filename', open('file.py', 'rb'), 'text/plain')}\n        )\n\n    r = requests.post('http://httpbin.org/post', data=m,\n                      headers={'Content-Type': m.content_type})\n\n\nYou can also use ``multipart/form-data`` encoding for requests that don't\nrequire files:\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    from requests_toolbelt import MultipartEncoder\n    import requests\n\n    m = MultipartEncoder(fields={'field0': 'value', 'field1': 'value'})\n\n    r = requests.post('http://httpbin.org/post', data=m,\n                      headers={'Content-Type': m.content_type})\n\n\nOr, you can just create the string and examine the data:\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    # Assuming `m` is one of the above\n    m.to_string()  # Always returns unicode\n\n\nUser-Agent constructor\n----------------------\n\nYou can easily construct a requests-style ``User-Agent`` string::\n\n    from requests_toolbelt import user_agent\n\n    headers = {\n        'User-Agent': user_agent('my_package', '0.0.1')\n        }\n\n    r = requests.get('https://api.github.com/users', headers=headers)\n\n\nSSLAdapter\n----------\n\nThe ``SSLAdapter`` was originally published on `Cory Benfield's blog`_. \nThis adapter allows the user to choose one of the SSL protocols made available \nin Python's ``ssl`` module for outgoing HTTPS connections:\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    from requests_toolbelt import SSLAdapter\n    import requests\n    import ssl\n\n    s = requests.Session()\n    s.mount('https://', SSLAdapter(ssl.PROTOCOL_TLSv1))\n\ncookies/ForgetfulCookieJar\n--------------------------\n\nThe ``ForgetfulCookieJar`` prevents a particular requests session from storing \ncookies:\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    from requests_toolbelt.cookies.forgetful import ForgetfulCookieJar\n\n    session = requests.Session()\n    session.cookies = ForgetfulCookieJar()\n\nKnown Issues\n------------\n\nOn Python 3.3.0 and 3.3.1, the standard library's ``http`` module will fail\nwhen passing an instance of the ``MultipartEncoder``. This is fixed in later\nminor releases of Python 3.3. Please consider upgrading to a later minor\nversion or Python 3.4. *There is absolutely nothing this library can do to\nwork around that bug.*\n\nContributing\n------------\n\nPlease read the `suggested workflow\n<https://toolbelt.readthedocs.org/en/latest/contributing.html>`_ for\ncontributing to this project.\n\nPlease report any bugs on the `issue tracker`_\n\n.. _Cory Benfield's blog: https://lukasa.co.uk/2013/01/Choosing_SSL_Version_In_Requests/\n.. _python-requests: https://github.com/kennethreitz/requests\n.. _issue tracker: https://github.com/requests/toolbelt/issues\n\n\nHistory\n=======\n\n0.9.1 -- 2019-01-29\n-------------------\n\nFixed Bugs\n~~~~~~~~~~\n\n- Fix import of pyOpenSSL shim from urllib3 for PKCS12 adapter\n\n0.9.0 -- 2019-01-29\n-------------------\n\nNew Features\n~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n- Add X509 Adapter that can handle PKCS12 \n- Add stateless solution for streaming files by MultipartEncoder from one host to another (in chunks)\n\nFixed Bugs\n~~~~~~~~~~\n\n- Update link to example\n- Move import of ``ABCs`` from collections into version-specific part of\n  _compat module\n- Fix backwards incompatibility in ``get_encodings_from_content``\n- Correct callback documentation for ``MultipartEncoderMonitor``\n- Fix bug when ``MultipartEncoder`` is asked to encode zero parts\n- Correct the type of non string request body dumps\n- Removed content from being stored in MultipartDecoder\n- Fix bug by enabling support for contenttype with capital letters. \n- Coerce proxy URL to bytes before dumping request\n- Avoid bailing out with exception upon empty response reason\n- Corrected Pool documentation\n- Corrected parentheses match in example usage\n- Fix \"oject\" to \"object\" in ``MultipartEncoder``\n- Fix URL for the project after the move \n- Add fix for OSX TCPKeepAliveAdapter\n\nMiscellaneous\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n- Remove py33 from testing and add Python 3.6 and nightly testing to the travis matrix.\n\n0.8.0 -- 2017-05-20\n-------------------\n\nMore information about this release can be found on the `0.8.0 milestone`_.\n\nNew Features\n~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n- Add ``UserAgentBuilder`` to provide more control over generated User-Agent\n  strings.\n\nFixed Bugs\n~~~~~~~~~~\n\n- Include ``_validate_certificate`` in the lits of picked attributes on the\n  ``AppEngineAdapter``.\n- Fix backwards incompatibility in ``get_encodings_from_content``\n\n.. _0.8.0 milestone:\n    https://github.com/requests/toolbelt/milestones/0.8.0\n\n0.7.1 -- 2017-02-13\n-------------------\n\nMore information about this release can be found on the `0.7.1 milestone`_.\n\nFixed Bugs\n~~~~~~~~~~\n\n- Fixed monkey-patching for the AppEngineAdapter.\n\n- Make it easier to disable certificate verification when monkey-patching\n  AppEngine.\n\n- Handle ``multipart/form-data`` bodies without a trailing ``CRLF``.\n\n\n.. links\n.. _0.7.1 milestone:\n    https://github.com/requests/toolbelt/milestone/9\n\n0.7.0 -- 2016-07-21\n-------------------\n\nMore information about this release can be found on the `0.7.0 milestone`_.\n\nNew Features\n~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n- Add ``BaseUrlSession`` to allow developers to have a session that has a\n  \"Base\" URL.

Moving forward we will make a best-effort attempt to\n  support 3.2 but will not test for it.\n\n\n.. _0.6.0 milestone:\n    https://github.com/requests/toolbelt/milestones/0.6.0\n\n0.5.1 -- 2015-12-16\n-------------------\n\nMore information about this release can be found on the `0.5.1 milestone`_.\n\nFixed Bugs\n~~~~~~~~~~\n\n- Now papers over the differences in requests' ``super_len`` function from\n  versions prior to 2.9.0 and versions 2.9.0 and later.\n\n\n.. _0.5.1 milestone:\n    https://github.com/requests/toolbelt/milestones/0.5.1\n\n0.5.0 -- 2015-11-24\n-------------------\n\nMore information about this release can be found on the `milestone\n<https://github.com/requests/toolbelt/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aall+milestone%3A0.5+>`_\nfor 0.5.0.\n\nNew Features\n~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n- The ``tee`` submodule was added to ``requests_toolbelt.downloadutils``. It\n  allows you to iterate over the bytes of a response while also writing them\n  to a file. The ``tee.tee`` function, expects you to pass an open file\n  object, while ``tee.tee_to_file`` will use the provided file name to open\n  the file for you.\n\n- Added a new parameter to ``requests_toolbelt.utils.user_agent`` that allows\n  the user to specify additional items.\n\n- Added nested form-data helper,\n  ``requests_toolbelt.utils.formdata.urlencode``.\n\n- Added the ``ForgetfulCookieJar`` to ``requests_toolbelt.cookies``.\n\n- Added utilities for dumping the information about a request-response cycle\n  in ``requests_toolbelt.utils.dump``.\n\n- Implemented the API described in the ``requests_toolbelt.threaded`` module\n  docstring, i.e., added ``requests_toolbelt.threaded.map`` as an available\n  function.\n\nFixed Bugs\n~~~~~~~~~~\n\n- Now papers over the API differences in versions of requests installed from\n  system packages versus versions of requests installed from PyPI.\n\n- Allow string types for ``SourceAddressAdapter``.\n\n0.4.0 -- 2015-04-03\n-------------------\n\nFor more information about this release, please see `milestone 0.4.0\n<https://github.com/requests/toolbelt/issues?q=milestone%3A0.4>`_\non the project's page.\n\nNew Features\n~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n- A naive implemenation of a thread pool is now included in the toolbelt. See\n  the docs in ``docs/threading.rst`` or on `Read The Docs\n  <https://toolbelt.readthedocs.org>`_.\n\n- The ``StreamingIterator`` now accepts files (such as ``sys.stdin``) without\n  a specific length and will properly stream them.\n\n- The ``MultipartEncoder`` now accepts exactly the same format of fields as\n  requests' ``files`` parameter does. In other words, you can now also pass in\n  extra headers to add to a part in the body. You can also now specify a\n  custom ``Content-Type`` for a part.\n\n- An implementation of HTTP Digest Authentication for Proxies is now included.\n\n- A transport adapter that allows a user to specify a specific Certificate\n  Fingerprint is now included in the toolbelt.\n\n- A transport adapter that simplifies how users specify socket options is now\n  included.\n\n- A transport adapter that simplifies how users can specify TCP Keep-Alive\n  options is now included in the toolbelt.\n\n- Deprecated functions from ``requests.utils`` are now included and\n  maintained.\n\n- An authentication tool that allows users to specify how to authenticate to\n  several different domains at once is now included.\n\n- A function to save streamed responses to disk by analyzing the\n  ``Content-Disposition`` header is now included in the toolbelt.\n\nFixed Bugs\n~~~~~~~~~~\n\n- The ``MultipartEncoder`` will now allow users to upload files larger than\n  4GB on 32-bit systems.\n\n- The ``MultipartEncoder`` will now accept empty unicode strings for form\n  values.\n\n0.3.1 -- 2014-06-23\n-------------------\n\n- Fix the fact that 0.3.0 bundle did not include the ``StreamingIterator``\n\n0.3.0 -- 2014-05-21\n-------------------\n\nBug Fixes\n~~~~~~~~~\n\n- Complete rewrite of ``MultipartEncoder`` fixes bug where bytes were lost in\n  uploads\n\nNew Features\n~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n- ``MultipartDecoder`` to accept ``multipart/form-data`` response bodies and\n  parse them into an easy to use object.\n\n- ``SourceAddressAdapter`` to allow users to choose a local address to bind\n  connections to.\n\n- ``GuessAuth`` which accepts a username and password and uses the\n  ``WWW-Authenticate`` header to determine how to authenticate against a\n  server.\n\n- ``MultipartEncoderMonitor`` wraps an instance of the ``MultipartEncoder``\n  and keeps track of how many bytes were read and will call the provided\n  callback.\n\n- ``StreamingIterator`` will wrap an iterator and stream the upload instead of\n  chunk it, provided you also provide the length of the content you wish to\n  upload.\n\n0.2.0 -- 2014-02-24\n-------------------\n\n- Add ability to tell ``MultipartEncoder`` which encoding to use. By default\n  it uses 'utf-8'.\n\n- Fix #10 - allow users to install with pip\n\n- Fix #9 - Fix ``MultipartEncoder#to_string`` so that it properly handles file\n  objects as fields\n\n0.1.2 -- 2014-01-19\n-------------------\n\n- At some point during development we broke how we handle normal file objects.\n  Thanks to @konomae this is now fixed.\n\n0.1.1 -- 2014-01-19\n-------------------\n\n- Handle ``io.BytesIO``-like objects better\n\n0.1.0 -- 2014-01-18\n-------------------\n\n- Add initial implementation of the streaming ``MultipartEncoder``\n\n- Add initial implementation of the ``user_agent`` function\n\n- Add the ``SSLAdapter``\n\n\n",
