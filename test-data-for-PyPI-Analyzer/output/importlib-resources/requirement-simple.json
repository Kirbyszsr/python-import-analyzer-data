Users of Python 3.9 and beyond\nshould use the standard library module, since for these versions,\n``importlib_resources`` just delegates to that module.\n\nThe key goal of this module is to replace parts of `pkg_resources\n<https://setuptools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pkg_resources.html>`_ with a\nsolution in Python's stdlib that relies on well-defined APIs.  This makes\nreading resources included in packages easier, with more stable and consistent\nsemantics.\n\n\n",
