  "description": "# filesystem_spec\n\n[![PyPI version](https://badge.fury.io/py/fsspec.svg)](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/fsspec/)\n[![Anaconda-Server Badge](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/fsspec/badges/version.svg)](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/fsspec)\n![Build](https://github.com/intake/filesystem_spec/workflows/CI/badge.svg)\n[![Docs](https://readthedocs.org/projects/filesystem-spec/badge/?version=latest)](https://filesystem-spec.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest)\n\nA specification for pythonic filesystems.\n\n## Install\n\n```bash\npip install fsspec\n```\nor\n```bash\nconda install -c conda-forge fsspec\n```\n\n## Purpose\n\nTo produce a template or specification for a file-system interface, that specific implementations should follow,\nso that applications making use of them can rely on a common behaviour and not have to worry about the specific\ninternal implementation decisions with any given backend. Many such implementations are included in this package,\nor in sister projects such as `s3fs` and `gcsfs`.\n\nIn addition, if this is well-designed, then additional functionality, such as a key-value store or FUSE\nmounting of the file-system implementation may be available for all implementations \"for free\".\n\n## Documentation\n\nPlease refer to [RTD](https://filesystem-spec.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest)\n\n## Develop\n\nfsspec uses [tox](https://tox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and\n[tox-conda](https://github.com/tox-dev/tox-conda) to manage dev and test\nenvironments. First, install conda with tox and tox-conda in a base environment\n(eg. `conda install -c conda-forge tox tox-conda`). Calls to `tox` can then be\nused to configure a development environment and run tests.\n\nFirst, setup a development conda environment via `tox -e dev`. This will\ninstall fspec dependencies, test & dev tools, and install fsspec in develop\nmode. Then, activate the dev environment under `.tox/dev` via `conda activate .tox/dev`.\n\n### Testing\n\nTests can be run directly in the activated dev environment via `pytest fsspec`.\n\nThe full fsspec test suite can be run via `tox`, which will setup and execute\ntests against multiple dependency versions in isolated environment. Run `tox\n-av` to list available test environments, select environments via `tox -e <env>`.\n\nThe full fsspec suite requires a system-level docker, docker-compose, and fuse\ninstallation. See `ci/install.sh` for a detailed installation example.\n\n### Code Formatting\n\nfsspec uses [Black](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable) to ensure\na consistent code format throughout the project. ``black`` is automatically\ninstalled in the tox dev env, activated via `conda activate .tox/dev`.\n\nThen, run `black fsspec` from the root of the filesystem_spec repository to\nauto-format your code. Additionally, many editors have plugins that will apply\n`black` as you edit files.\n\nOptionally, you may wish to setup [pre-commit hooks](https://pre-commit.com) to\nautomatically run `black` when you make a git commit. ``black`` is automatically\ninstalled in the tox dev env, activated via `conda activate .tox/dev`.\n\nThen, run `pre-commit install --install-hooks` from the root of the\nfilesystem_spec repository to setup pre-commit hooks. `black` will now be run\nbefore you commit, reformatting any changed files. You can format without\ncommitting via `pre-commit run` or skip these checks with `git commit\n--no-verify`.\n\n\n",
