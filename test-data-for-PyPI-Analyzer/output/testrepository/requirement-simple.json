  "description": "Test Repository\n+++++++++++++++\n\nOverview\n~~~~~~~~\n\nThis project provides a database of test results which can be used as part of\ndeveloper workflow to ensure/check things like:\n\n* No commits without having had a test failure, test fixed cycle.\n* No commits without new tests being added.\n* What tests have failed since the last commit (to run just a subset).\n* What tests are currently failing and need work.\n\nTest results are inserted using subunit (and thus anything that can output\nsubunit or be converted into a subunit stream can be accepted).\n\nA mailing list for discussion, usage and development is at\nhttps://launchpad.net/~testrepository-dev - all are welcome to join.
