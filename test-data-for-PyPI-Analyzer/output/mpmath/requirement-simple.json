Download & installation\n--------------------------\n\nMpmath requires Python 2.7 or 3.4 (or later versions). It has been tested\nwith CPython 2.7, 3.4 through 3.7 and for PyPy.\n\nThe latest release of mpmath can be downloaded from the mpmath\nwebsite and from https://github.com/fredrik-johansson/mpmath/releases\n\nIt should also be available in the Python Package Index at\nhttps://pypi.python.org/pypi/mpmath\n\nTo install latest release of Mpmath with pip, simply run\n\n``pip install mpmath``\n\nOr unpack the mpmath archive and run\n\n``python setup.py install``\n\nMpmath can also be installed using\n\n``python -m easy_install mpmath``\n\nThe latest development code is available from\nhttps://github.com/fredrik-johansson/mpmath\n\nSee the main documentation for more detailed instructions.\n\n2. Running tests\n----------------\n\nThe unit tests in mpmath/tests/ can be run via the script\nruntests.py, but it is recommended to run them with py.test\n(https://pytest.org/), especially\nto generate more useful reports in case there are failures.\n\nYou may also want to check out the demo scripts in the demo\ndirectory.\n\nThe master branch is automatically tested by Travis CI.\n\n3. Documentation\n----------------\n\nDocumentation in reStructuredText format is available in the\ndoc directory included with the source package. These files\nare human-readable, but can be compiled to prettier HTML using\nthe build.py script (requires Sphinx, http://sphinx.pocoo.org/).\n\nSee setup.txt in the documentation for more information.\n\nThe most recent documentation is also available in HTML format:\n\nhttp://mpmath.org/doc/current/\n\n4. Known problems\n-----------------\n\nMpmath is a work in progress. Major issues include:\n\n* Some functions may return incorrect values when given extremely\n  large arguments or arguments very close to singularities.\n\n* Directed rounding works for arithmetic operations. It is implemented\n  heuristically for other operations, and their results may be off by one\n  or two units in the last place (even if otherwise accurate).\n\n* Some IEEE 754 features are not available. Inifinities and NaN are\n  partially supported; denormal rounding is currently not available\n  at all.\n\n* The interface for switching precision and rounding is not finalized.\n  The current method is not threadsafe.\n\n5. Help and bug reports\n-----------------------\n\nGeneral questions and comments can be sent to the mpmath mailinglist,\nmpmath@googlegroups.com\n\nYou can also report bugs and send patches to the mpmath issue tracker,\nhttps://github.com/fredrik-johansson/mpmath/issues\n\n\n",
